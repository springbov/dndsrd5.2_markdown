Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell
prepared in your mind or have access to the spell
from a magic item, such as a
. Your fea-
tures specify which spells you have access to, if any;
whether you always have certain spells prepared;
and whether you can change the list of spells you

have prepared.

If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your
spellcasting feature specifies when you can change
the list and the number of spells you can change, as

Always-Prepared Spells
of prepared spells, but the GM is free to alter them.

Certain features might give you a spell that you
always have prepared. If you also have a list of pre-
pared spells that you can change, a spell that you
always have prepared doesn’t count against the
Casting Spells
number of spells on that list.

Each spell description has a series of entries that
provide the details needed to cast the spell. The fol-
lowing sections explain each of those entries, which
follow a spell’s name.

castinG in arMor
You must have training with any armor you are wear-
ing to cast spells while wearing it. You are otherwise
too hampered by the armor for spellcasting.

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indi-
cated in a spell’s description. A spell’s level is an
indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips—simple
spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0.
The rules for each spellcasting class say when its
Spell Slots
members gain access to spells of certain levels.

Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only
a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting.
Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster’s magical
potential is represented. Each spellcasting class
gives its members a limited number of spell slots of
certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard
has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.
  When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that
spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with
the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain
size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a high-
er-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any
Magic
size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that’s at
Missile
least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts

, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of

four level 1 slots and has three remaining.
  Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell
slots.Casting without Slots

There are several ways to cast a spell without
Cantrips.
expending a spell slot:
Rituals

 A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.
. Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the
Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast fol-
lowing the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can
be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell
takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it
doesn’t expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Rit-
ual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.

Special Abilities.

Magic Items.

 Some characters and monsters
have special abilities that allow them to cast spe-
cific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usu-
ally limited in another way, such as being able to
cast the spell a limited number of times per day.
 and some other magic
items contain spells that can be cast without a
spell slot. The description of such an item speci-
fies how many times a spell can be cast from it.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

Spell Scrolls

When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is
of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on
the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a
Magic Missile
Wizard casts

 using a level 2 slot, that

Magic Missile

 is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands

to fill the slot it is put into.

Each spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools
are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These cate-
gories help describe spells but have no rules of their

Class Spell Lists

If a spell is on a class’s spell list, the class’s name
appears in parentheses after the spell’s school of
magic. Some features add a spell to a character’s
spell list even if the character isn’t a member of a
Casting Time
class in the parentheses.

Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but
some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 1
minute or more. A spell’s Casting Time entry speci-
One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn
fies which of those is required.

On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast
a spell. This rule means you can’t, for example, cast
a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and
Reaction and Bonus Action Triggers
another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn.

A spell that has a casting time of a Reaction is cast
in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell’s
Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting
time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a
Longer Casting Times
trigger defined in the spell.

Certain spells—including a spell cast as a Rit-
ual—require more time to cast: minutes or even
hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of
1 minute or more, you must take the Magic action
on each of your turns, and you must maintain Con-
centration (see “Rules Glossary”) while you do so. If

your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you
don’t expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again, you
Range
must start over.

A spell’s range indicates how far from the spell-
caster the spell’s effect can originate, and the spell’s
description specifies which part of the effect is lim-
ited by the range.
Distance.
  A range usually takes one of the following forms:
Touch

 The range is expressed in feet.

. The spell’s effect originates on something,
as defined by the spell, that the spellcaster must
touch within their reach.

Self.

 The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates

from them, as specified in the spell.

If a spell has movable effects, they aren’t restricted
by its range unless the spell’s description says
Components
otherwise.

A spell’s components are physical requirements the
spellcaster must meet to cast the spell. Each spell’s
description indicates whether it requires Verbal
(V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. If the
spellcaster can’t provide one or more of a spell’s
Verbal (V)
components, the spellcaster can’t cast the spell.

A Verbal component is the chanting of esoteric
words that sound like nonsense to the uninitiated.
The words must be uttered in a normal speaking
voice. The words themselves aren’t the source of the
spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of
sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the
threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is
gagged or in an area of magical silence can’t cast a
Somatic (S)
spell with a Verbal component.

A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation
or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must
use at least one of their hands to perform these
Material (M)
movements.

A Material component is a particular material used
in a spell’s casting, as specified in parentheses in
the Components entry. These materials aren’t con-
sumed by the spell unless the spell’s description
states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand
free to access them, but it can be the same hand
used to perform Somatic components, if any.
  If a spell doesn’t consume its materials and
doesn’t specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use
a Component Pouch (see “Equipment”) instead of
providing the materials specified in the spell, or the

105

System Reference Document 5.2spellcaster can substitute a Spellcasting Focus if the
caster has a feature that allows that substitution. To
use a Component Pouch, you must have a hand free
to reach into it, and to use a Spellcasting Focus, you
must hold it unless its description says otherwise
Duration
(see “Equipment” for descriptions).

A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell per-
sists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of
Concentration.
the following forms:

 A duration that requires Concen-

tration follows the Concentration rules (see “Rules
Instantaneous.
Glossary”).

 An instantaneous duration means
the spell’s magic appears only for a moment and
then disappears.

Time Span.

 A duration that provides a time span
specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, min-
utes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration
entry might say “1 minute,” meaning the spell
ends after 1 minute has passed. While a time-span
spell that you cast is ongoing, you can dismiss it
(no action required) if you don’t have the Incapac-
itated condition.

Effects

The effects of a spell are detailed after its dura-
tion entry. Those details present exactly what the
spell does, which ignores mundane physical laws;
any outcomes beyond those effects are under the
GM’s purview. Whatever the effects, they typically
deal with targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all
Targets
three, each of which is detailed below.

A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or
more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A
spell’s description says whether the spell targets
creatures, objects, or something else.

A Clear Path to the Target.

 To target something
with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so
it can’t be behind Total Cover.

Targeting Yourself.

 If a spell targets a creature
of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the
creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature
other than you.
wave

Areas of Effect.

Thunder-

 Some spells, such as
, cover an area called an area of effect, which

is defined in “Rules Glossary.” The area determines
what the spell targets. The description of a spell
specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is
typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder,
Emanation, Line, or Sphere.

106

Awareness of Being Targeted.

 Unless a spell has
a perceptible effect, a creature doesn’t know it was
targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is ob-
vious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt
to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell’s
description says otherwise.

Invalid Targets.

 If you cast a spell on someone
or something that can’t be affected by it, nothing
happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to
cast the spell, the slot is still expended.
  If the spell normally has no effect on a target that
succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target ap-
pears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even
though it didn’t attempt one (giving no hint that the
creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you per-
Saving Throws
ceive that the spell did nothing to the target.

Many spells specify that a target makes a saving
throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The
spell specifies the ability that the target uses for
the save and what happens on a success or failure.
Spell save DC = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier
Here’s how to calculate the DC for your spells:
+ your Proficiency Bonus

Attack Rolls

Some spells require the caster to make an attack
roll to determine whether the spell hits a target.
Here’s how to calculate the attack modifier for your
spells:Spell attack modifier = your spellcasting ability
modifier + your Proficiency Bonus

Combining Spell Effects

Bless

The effects of different spells add together while
their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of
the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine.
Instead, the most potent effect—such as the high-
est bonus—from those castings applies while their
durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if
the castings are equally potent and their durations
overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast
the same target, that target gains the spell’s benefit
only once; the target doesn’t receive two bonus dice.
But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect
continues until the duration of the second
ends.
idEntiFyinG an onGoinG spEll
You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by
its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To
identify it, you must take the Study action and suc-
ceed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

A Tiny Beast of your choice that you can see within
range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw,
or it attempts to deliver a message for you (if the
target’s Challenge Rating isn’t 0, it automatically
succeeds). You specify a location you have visited
and a recipient who matches a general descrip-
tion, such as “a person dressed in the uniform of
the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a
pointed hat.” You also communicate a message of
up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels for the
duration toward the specified location, covering
about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast
can fly.
  When the Beast arrives, it delivers your message
to the creature that you described, mimicking your
communication. If the Beast doesn’t reach its desti-
nation before the spell ends, the message is lost, and
the Beast returns to where you cast the spell.

Choose any number of willing creatures that you
can see within range. Each target shape-shifts into
a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that has a
Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a dif-
ferent form for each target. On later turns, you can
take a Magic action to transform the targets again.
  A target’s game statistics are replaced by the
chosen Beast’s statistics, but the target retains its
creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; alignment;
ability to communicate; and Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma scores. The target’s actions are lim-
ited by the Beast form’s anatomy, and it can’t cast
spells. The target’s equipment melds into the new
form, and the target can’t use any of that equipment
while in that form.
  The target gains a number of Temporary Hit

Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or
Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes
an Undead creature: a

or a
 if you chose a corpse (see “Monsters”
for the stat blocks).
  On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Ac-
tion to mentally command any creature you made
with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of
you (if you control multiple creatures, you can
command any of them at the same time, issuing the
same command to each one). You decide what action
the creature will take and where it will move on
its next turn, or you can issue a general command,
such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue
no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action
and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order,
the creature continues to follow it until its task is
complete.
  The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you’ve
given it. To maintain control of the creature for an-
other 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the crea-
ture again before the current 24-hour period ends.

Objects animate at your command. Choose a num-
ber of nonmagical objects within range that aren’t
being worn or carried, aren’t fixed to a surface, and
aren’t Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects
is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; for
this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as

As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates
antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or
object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of
creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom
saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the
target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy deter-
mines what happens to a creature when it fails that

Level 9 Necromancy (Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)

Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (for each of the spell’s targets,

one jacinth worth 1,000+ GP and one silver bar worth
100+ GP, all of which the spell consumes)

Duration: Until dispelled

You and up to eight willing creatures within range
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane
(the spell ends instantly if you are already on that
plane). Each target’s body is left behind in a state of
suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condi-
tion, doesn’t need food or air, and doesn’t age.
  A target’s astral form resembles its body in almost
every way, replicating its game statistics and pos-
sessions. The principal difference is the addition of
a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder
blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view
after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only
when an effect states that it does so—the target’s
body and astral form both die.
  A target’s astral form can travel through the As-
tral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that
plane, the target’s body and possessions travel
along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter
its body on the new plane.
  Any damage or other effects that apply to an as-
tral form have no effect on the target’s body and
vice versa. If a target’s body or astral form drops to
0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell
ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to
dismiss it.

  When the spell ends for a target who isn’t dead,
the target reappears in its body and exits the state
Augury
of suspended animation.

You teleport to a location within range. You arrive
at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can
see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe

northwest at a 45-degree angle.”
  You can also teleport one willing creature. The
creature must be within 5 feet of you when you tele-
port, and it teleports to a space within 5 feet of your
destination space.

or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0.
Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the
familiar has the statistics of the chosen form (see
“Monsters”), though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend
(your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts
independently of you, but it obeys your commands.

Telepathic Connection.

 While your familiar is

within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it
telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you
can see through the familiar’s eyes and hear what it
hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the
benefits of any special senses it has.
  Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of
touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your fa-

the spell.

 The familiar is an ally to you and your

allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own
turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other
actions as normal.

Disappearance of the Familiar.

 When the famil-
iar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears
after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action,
you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket
dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever.
As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed,
you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space
within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops
to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimen-
sion, it leaves behind in its space anything it was

your choice, such as a horse, a camel, a dire wolf,

 The steed is an ally to you and your al-

it functions as a controlled mount while you ride it
(as defined in the rules on mounted combat). If you
have the Incapacitated condition, the steed takes
its turn immediately after yours and acts inde-

tution saving throw. On a failed save, it has the Re-
strained condition for the duration. On a successful
save, its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn.
Constructs automatically succeed on the save.
  A Restrained target makes another Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it
successfully saves against this spell three times,
the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is

Duration: 1 hour

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of
force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats
3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space
of your choice that you can see within range. The
disk remains for the duration and can hold up to
500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell
ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
  The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet
of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the
disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of
you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down
stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an ele-
vation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the
disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could
it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.
  If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typ-

You create a ward against magical travel that pro-

height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration,
creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals,
such as those created by the

which the spell consumes)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

An immobile, Invisible, Cube-shaped prison com-
posed of magical force springs into existence
around an area you choose within range. The prison
can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.
  A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet
on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars
spaced 1/2 inch apart. A prison in the shape of a box
can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid bar-
rier that prevents any matter from passing through
it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the
area.
  When you cast the spell, any creature that is com-
pletely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures
only partially within the area, or those too large to
fit inside it, are pushed away from the center of the
area until they are completely outside it.
  A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by non-
magical means. If the creature tries to use telepor-
tation or interplanar travel to leave, it must first
make a Charisma saving throw. On a successful
save, the creature can use that magic to exit the
cage. On a failed save, the creature doesn’t exit the
cage and wastes the spell or effect. The cage also
extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal
travel.

Range: 300 feet

Duration: Instantaneous

A frigid globe streaks from you to a point of
your choice within range, where it explodes in a
60-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area
makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6
Cold damage on failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one.
  If the globe strikes a body of water, it freezes the
water to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet
square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that
were swimming on the surface of frozen water are
trapped in the ice and have the Restrained condi-
tion. A trapped creature can take an action to make
a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save
DC to break free.
  You can refrain from firing the globe after com-
pleting the spell’s casting. If you do so, a globe about
the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears
in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you
give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of
40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal
range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect
as a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the
globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if

Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth 5,000+ GP)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space
you can see within range to a precise location on a
different plane of existence. The portal is a circular
opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diam-
eter. You can orient the portal in any direction you
choose. The portal lasts for the duration, and the
portal’s destination is visible through it.
  The portal has a front and a back on each plane
where it appears. Travel through the portal is possi-
ble only by moving through its front. Anything that
does so is instantly transported to the other plane,
appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the
portal.
  Deities and other planar rulers can prevent por-
tals created by this spell from opening in their pres-
ence or anywhere within their domains.
  When you cast this spell, you can speak the name
of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nick-
name doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane
other than the one you are on, the portal opens
next to the named creature and transports it to the
nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal.
You gain no special power over the creature, and it
is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might

Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200+

GP, which the spell consumes)

Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical
effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a
table or a section of floor) or within an object that
can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal
the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger
than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is
moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this
spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends with-
out being triggered.
  The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a
successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your
spell save DC to notice.
  When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger
and choose whether it’s an explosive rune or a spell
glyph, as explained below.

Set the Trigger.

 You decide what triggers the

glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed
on a surface, common triggers include touching or
stepping on the glyph, removing another object cov-
ering it, or approaching within a certain distance of
it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common
triggers include opening that object or seeing the
glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
  You can refine the trigger so that only creatures
of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph
could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set
conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph,
  Explosive Rune.
such as those who say a certain password.

 When triggered, the glyph erupts
with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere cen-
tered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes
a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid,
Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your

or half as much damage on a successful one.

 You can store a prepared spell of

level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of
creating the glyph. The spell must target a single
creature or an area. The spell being stored has no
immediate effect when cast in this way.
  When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell
takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the
creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects
an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the
spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful
objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to
the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Con-

Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a mushroom)
Duration: 24 hours

You make natural terrain in a 150-foot Cube in
range look, sound, and smell like another sort of
natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be
made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some
other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be
made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like
a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and
smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment,
and creatures within the area aren’t changed.
  The tactile characteristics of the terrain are un-
changed, so creatures entering the area are likely
to notice the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious
by touch, a creature examining the illusion can take
the Study action to make an Intelligence (Investiga-

it. If a creature discerns that the terrain is illusory,

Duration: Until dispelled

You touch the sapphire used in the casting and an
object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest
dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an Invis-
ible mark on that object and invisibly inscribes the
object’s name on the sapphire. Each time you cast
this spell, you must use a different sapphire.
  Thereafter, you can take a Magic action to speak
the object’s name and crush the sapphire. The ob-
ject instantly appears in your hand regardless of
physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.
  If another creature is holding or carrying the ob-
ject, crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport it, but
instead you learn who that creature is and where
that creature is currently located.

  The target can move only by pushing or pulling
against a fixed object or surface within reach (such
as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it
were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude
by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If
you are the target, you can move up or down as part
of your move. Otherwise, you can take a Magic ac-

Protection from Evil and Good

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul
leaves it and enters the container you used for the
spell’s Material component. While your soul inhab-
its the container, you are aware of your surround-
ings as if you were in the container’s space. You
can’t move or take Reactions. The only action you
can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of
the container, either returning to your living body
(and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a
Humanoid’s body.
  You can attempt to possess any Humanoid within
100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded
by a
spell can’t be possessed). The target makes a Cha-
risma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul en-
ters the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes
trapped in the container. On a successful save, the
target resists your efforts to possess it, and you
can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.
  Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it.
Your Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Speed, and senses are replaced by the
creature’s. You otherwise keep your game statistics.
  Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can per-
ceive from the container using its own senses, but it
can’t move and it is Incapacitated.
  While possessing a body, you can take a Magic ac-
tion to return from the host body to the container if
it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host crea-
ture’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while
you’re in it, the creature dies, and you make a Cha-
risma saving throw against your own spellcasting
DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is
within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.
  If the container is destroyed or the spell ends,
your soul returns to your body. If your body is more
than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead,
you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container
when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to

its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Oth-
erwise, that creature dies.

  When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (jade dust worth 10+ GP, which

Duration: Until dispelled

You implant a message within an object in range—a
message that is uttered when a trigger condition is
met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t
being worn or carried by another creature. Then
speak the message, which must be 25 words or
fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10
minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that
will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
  When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth ap-
pears on the object and recites the message in your
voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the ob-
ject you chose has a mouth or something that looks
like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue),
the magical mouth appears there, so the words
appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you
cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it
delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its
message whenever the trigger occurs.
  The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you
like, though it must be based on visual or audible
conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object.
For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak
when any creature moves within 30 feet of the ob-

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature door worth 15+ GP)
Duration: 24 hours

You conjure a shimmering door in range that lasts
for the duration. The door leads to an extradimen-
sional dwelling and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall.
You and any creature you designate when you cast
the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling
as long as the door remains open. You can open or
close it (no action required) if you are within 30 feet
of it. While closed, the door is imperceptible.
  Beyond the door is a magnificent foyer with
numerous chambers beyond. The dwelling’s atmo-
sphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
  You can create any floor plan you like for the
dwelling, but it can’t exceed 50 contiguous 10-foot
Cubes. The place is furnished and decorated as you
choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-
course banquet for up to 100 people. Furnishings
and other objects created by this spell dissipate into
smoke if removed from it.
  A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends
all who enter. You determine the appearance of
these servants and their attire. They are invulner-
able and obey your commands. Each servant can
perform tasks that a human could perform, but they
can’t attack or take any action that would directly
harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch
things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve
food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can’t leave
the dwelling.
  When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left
inside the extradimensional space are expelled into

than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot
that you can see within range and lasts for the du-
ration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but
it can’t deal damage or cause conditions.
  If you are within range of the illusion, you can
take a Magic action to cause the image to move to
any other spot within range. As the image changes
location, you can alter its appearance so that its
movements appear natural for the image. For exam-
ple, if you create an image of a creature and move
it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be
walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to
make different sounds at different times, even mak-
ing it carry on a conversation, for example.
  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to
be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A crea-
ture that takes a Study action to examine the image
can determine that it is an illusion with a success-

You suggest a course of activity—described in no

you can see within range that can hear and under-
stand you. The suggestion must sound achievable
and not involve anything that would obviously deal
damage to any of the targets or their allies. For
example, you could say, “Walk to the village down
that road, and help the villagers there harvest crops
until sunset.” Or you could say, “Now is not the time
for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop in
an hour.”
  Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or have the Charmed condition for the dura-
tion or until you or your allies deal damage to the
target. Each Charmed target pursues the suggestion
to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can
continue for the entire duration, but if the sug-
gested activity can be completed in a shorter time,
the spell ends for a target upon completing it.

You step into a stone object or surface large enough
to fully contain your body, merging yourself and
your equipment with the stone for the duration.
You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your
presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by
nonmagical senses.
  While merged with the stone, you can’t see what
occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception)
checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made
with Disadvantage. You remain aware of the pas-
sage of time and can cast spells on yourself while
merged in the stone. You can use 5 feet of movement
to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends
the spell. You otherwise can’t move.
  Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm
you, but its partial destruction or a change in its
shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it)
expels you and deals 6d6 Force damage to you. The

as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it
must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image
can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory
effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it

Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Wizard)

Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Sight
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square
look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other
sort of terrain. Open fields or a road could be made
to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other
rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to
seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle
slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth
road.
  Similarly, you can alter the appearance of struc-
tures or add them where none are present. The spell
doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
  The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and
olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground

  Creatures with Truesight can see through the illu-
sion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other el-
ements of the illusion remain, so while the creature
is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can

Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action

Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your
space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with
you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s
impossible to track which image is real.
  Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll
during the spell’s duration, roll a d6 for each of
your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls
a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of
you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates
otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The
spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
  A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the

You gain the Invisible condition at the same time
that an illusory double of you appears where you
are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but
the invisibility ends immediately after you make an
attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.
  As a Magic action, you can move the illusory dou-
ble up to twice your Speed and make it gesture,
speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It is

Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature’s mem-
ories. One creature that you can see within range
makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting
the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a
failed save, the target has the Charmed condition
for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the
target also has the Incapacitated condition and is
unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear
you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another
spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.
  While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s
memory of an event that it experienced within the
last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 min-
utes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of
the event, allow the target to recall the event with
perfect clarity, change its memory of the event’s de-
tails, or create a memory of some other event.
  You must speak to the target to describe how its
memories are affected, and it must be able to under-
stand your language for the modified memories to
take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of
your description. If the spell ends before you finish
describing the modified memories, the creature’s
memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified
memories take hold when the spell ends.
  A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect
how a creature behaves, particularly if the mem-
ory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations,
alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory,
such as a false memory of how much the creature
enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad
dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too
nonsensical to affect a creature.

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature shovel)
Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on
a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or
clay in the area in any manner you choose for the
duration. You can raise or lower the area’s eleva-
tion, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall,
or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes
can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. For
example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can
create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the
square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up
to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for
these changes to complete. Because the terrain’s
transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area
can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s
movement.
  At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concen-
trating on the spell, you can choose a new area of
terrain to affect within range.
  This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone
construction. Rocks and structures shift to accom-
modate the new terrain. If the way you shape the
terrain would make a structure unstable, it might
collapse.
  Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant
growth. The moved earth carries any plants along

For the duration, you hide a target that you touch

A passage appears at a point that you can see on a
wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall,
ceiling, or floor) within range and lasts for the dura-
tion. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5
feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage
creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.
  When the opening disappears, any creatures or
objects still in the passage created by the spell are
safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the

Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a
creature you can see within range. The target
makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed
save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or
other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot
Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for
the duration. The phantasm includes sound, tem-
perature, and other stimuli.
  The target can take a Study action to examine the
phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds,

151

System Reference Document 5.2the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion,
and the spell ends.
  While affected by the spell, the target treats the
phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any il-
logical outcomes from interacting with it. For exam-
ple, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge
and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists
and something else caused it to fall.
  An affected target can even take damage from
the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous
creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a
phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the tar-
get if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of
the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a

type appropriate to the illusion.
Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)

Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can
see within range and create an illusion of its deep-
est fears, visible only to that creature. The target
makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
target takes 4d10 Psychic damage and has Disad-
vantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the
duration. On a successful save, the target takes half
as much damage, and the spell ends.
  For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom sav-

A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on
the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice
within range. You decide the creature’s appearance,
and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any
of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a
puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away
from the steed.
Riding Horse
  For the duration, you or a creature you choose
can ride the steed. The steed uses the
stat block (see “Monsters”), except it has a Speed of
100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When
the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the
rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if
the steed takes any damage.

Planar Ally
Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)

Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The be-
ing must be known to you: a god, a demon prince, or
some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends
a Celestial, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to it to aid
you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied
space within range. If you know a specific creature’s
name, you can speak that name when you cast this
spell to request that creature, though you might get
a different creature anyway (GM’s choice).
  When the creature appears, it is under no com-
pulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it
to perform a service in exchange for payment, but
it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could
range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help
us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or
protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You
must be able to communicate with the creature to
bargain for its services.
  Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial
might require a sizable donation of gold or magic
items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might de-
mand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some
creatures might exchange their service for a quest
undertaken by you.
  A task that can be measured in minutes requires a
payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured
in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task
measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000
GP per day. The GM can adjust these payments
based on the circumstances under which you cast
the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s
ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.
Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the
suggested payment, while especially dangerous
tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely
accept tasks that seem suicidal.
  After the creature completes the task, or when the
agreed-upon duration of service expires, the crea-
ture returns to its home plane after reporting back
to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a
price for the creature’s service, the creature imme-

System Reference Document 5.2Magic Circle

You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a
Fey, or a Fiend to your service. The creature must
be within range for the entire casting of the spell.
(Typically, the creature is first summoned into the
center of the inverted version of the
spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the com-
pletion of the casting, the target must succeed on
a Charisma saving throw or be bound to serve you
for the duration. If the creature was summoned or
created by another spell, that spell’s duration is ex-
tended to match the duration of this spell.
  A bound creature must follow your commands
to the best of its ability. You might command the
creature to accompany you on an adventure, to
guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the
creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your com-
mands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature
carries out your commands completely before the
spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you
are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a
different plane, it returns to the place where you

transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied

This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting
time you use determines whether the spell has the

Overgrowth.

 Choose a point within range. All

normal plants in a 100-foot-radius Sphere centered
on that point become thick and overgrown. A crea-

movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude
one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area
from being affected.

You attempt to transform a creature that you can
see within range into a Beast. The target must suc-
ceed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into
a Beast form for the duration. That form can be any
Beast you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal
to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level if
it doesn’t have a Challenge Rating). The target’s
game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the
chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment,
personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point
Dice. See the “Animals” section of “Monsters” for a
sample of Beast stat blocks.
  The target gains a number of Temporary Hit
Points equal to the Hit Points of the Beast form.
These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain
when the spell ends. The spell ends early on the tar-
get if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.
  The target is limited in the actions it can perform

Level 9 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)

Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms
a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet
high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point within
range. Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe
up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within
range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you posi-
tion the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the
spell ends instantly without effect.
  The wall sheds Bright Light within 100 feet and
Dim Light for an additional 100 feet. You and crea-
tures you designate when you cast the spell can
pass through and be near the wall without harm. If
another creature that can see the wall moves within
20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or
have the Blinded condition for 1 minute.
  The wall consists of seven layers, each with a
different color. When a creature reaches into or
passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a
time through all the layers. Each layer forces the
creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be af-

Level 6 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet

Components: V, S, M (jade dust worth 25+ GP)
Duration: Until dispelled

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon within range that
activates when a specific trigger occurs. The illu-
sion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger
than a 30-foot Cube, and you decide when you cast
the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds
it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5
minutes.
  When the trigger you specify occurs, the illusion
springs into existence and performs in the manner
you described. Once the illusion finishes perform-
ing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 min-
utes, after which the illusion can be activated again.
  The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you
like, though it must be based on visual or audible
phenomena that occur within 30 feet of the area.
For example, you could create an illusion of yourself
to appear and warn off others who attempt to open
a trapped door.
  Physical interaction with the image reveals it
to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A
creature that takes the Study action to examine
the image can determine that it is an illusion with a
successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against
your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illu-
sion for what it is, the creature can see through the
image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the

creature.
Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 500 miles
Components: V, S, M (a statuette of yourself worth

5+ GP)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for
the duration. The copy can appear at any location
within range that you have seen before, regardless
of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and
sounds like you, but it is intangible. If the illusion
takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
  You can see through the illusion’s eyes and hear
through its ears as if you were in its space. As a
Magic action, you can move it up to 60 feet and
make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way
you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

ture must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or
be enclosed for the duration.
  Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other
spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or
out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe
there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a
creature or object inside can’t be damaged by at-
tacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a
creature inside the sphere damage anything outside
it.
  The sphere is weightless and just large enough to
contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed
creature can take an action to push against the
sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half
the creature’s Speed. Similarly, the globe can be

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-
foot high Cylinder centered on a point within range.
All creatures and objects in that area that aren’t
anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the
top of the Cylinder. A creature can make a Dexterity
saving throw to grab a fixed object it can reach, thus
avoiding the fall upward.
  If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered
in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it
just as they would during a downward fall. If an af-
fected creature or object reaches the Cylinder’s top
without striking anything, it hovers there for the
duration. When the spell ends, affected objects and

dimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.
That space can be reached by climbing the rope,
which can be pulled into or dropped out of it.

nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).
  While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane,
you can take a Magic action and touch the replica to
recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space
on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the
chest back to the Ethereal Plane by taking a Magic
action to touch the chest and the replica.
  After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent
chance at the end of each day that the spell ends.

Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 8 hours

You give an illusory appearance to each creature of
your choice that you can see within range. An un-
willing target can make a Charisma saving throw,

  You can give the same appearance or different
ones to the targets. The spell can change the ap-
pearance of the targets’ bodies and equipment.
You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or
taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target’s new
appearance must have the same basic arrangement
of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion

Range: Unlimited
Components: V, S, M (a copper wire)
Duration: Instantaneous

You send a short message of 25 words or fewer to
a creature you have met or a creature described to
you by someone who has met it. The target hears
the message in its mind, recognizes you as the
sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like
manner immediately. The spell enables targets to
understand the meaning of your message.
  You can send the message across any distance and
even to other planes of existence, but if the target
is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent
chance that the message doesn’t arrive. You know if
the delivery fails.
  Upon receiving your message, a creature can
block your ability to reach it again with this spell for
8 hours. If you try to send another message during
that time, you learn that you are blocked, and the

pended animation; it has the Unconscious condition,
doesn’t age, and doesn’t need food, water, or air.
  You can set a condition for the spell to end early.
The condition can be anything you choose, but it
must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target.

  When you cast the spell, you gain a number of
Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the
first form into which you shape-shift. These Tempo-
rary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon that is no larger
than a 15-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot
within range and lasts for the duration. The image
is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound,
smell, or other sensory effects.
  As a Magic action, you can cause the image
to move to any spot within range. As the image
changes location, you can alter its appearance so
that its movements appear natural for the image.
For example, if you create an image of a creature
and move it, you can alter the image so that it ap-
pears to be walking.
  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to
be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A
creature that takes a Study action to examine the
image can determine that it is an illusion with a

sion for what it is, the creature can see through the

the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the
creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same
size as that creature, and the pile turns into the
simulacrum, which is a creature. It uses the game
statistics of the original creature at the time of cast-
ing, except it is a Construct, its Hit Point maximum
is half as much, and it can’t cast this spell.
  The simulacrum is Friendly to you and creatures
you designate. It obeys your commands and acts on
your turn in combat. The simulacrum can’t gain lev-
els, and it can’t take Short or Long Rests.
  If the simulacrum takes damage, the only way
to restore its Hit Points is to repair it as you take a
Long Rest, during which you expend components
worth 100 GP per Hit Point restored. The simula-
crum must stay within 5 feet of you for the repair.
  The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 Hit Points,
at which point it reverts to snow and melts away. If
you cast this spell again, any simulacrum you cre-

Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius
Sphere centered on a point within range must suc-

You alter time around up to six creatures of your
choice in a 40-foot Cube within range. Each target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be af-
fected by this spell for the duration.
  An affected target’s Speed is halved, it takes a −2
penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it
can’t take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either
an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can
make only one attack if it takes the Attack action. If
it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is
a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the
target making the spell’s gestures too slowly.
  An affected target repeats the save at the end
of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a

Level 3 Necromancy (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (burning incense)
Duration: 10 minutes

You grant the semblance of life to a corpse of your
choice within range, allowing it to answer ques-
tions you pose. The corpse must have a mouth, and
this spell fails if the deceased creature was Undead
when it died. The spell also fails if the corpse was
the target of this spell within the past 10 days.
  Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to
five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew
in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are
usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse
is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if
you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes you
as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s
soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the
corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t compre-
hend anything that has happened since it died, and

simple commands. You can question plants about
events in the spell’s area within the past day, gain-
ing information about creatures that have passed,
weather, and other circumstances.
  You can also turn Difficult Terrain caused by plant
growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into
ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you

can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 1,000+

GP, which the spell consumes)

Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface
(such as a section of floor or wall) or within an ob-
ject that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The
glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in
diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in
place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where
you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell
ends without being triggered.
  The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a
successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your
spell save DC to notice.
  When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger
and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death,
Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is
explained below.

Set the Trigger.

 You decide what triggers the

glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed
on a surface, common triggers include touching or
stepping on the glyph, removing another object cov-
ering it, or approaching within a certain distance of
it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common
triggers include opening that object or seeing the
glyph.
  You can refine the trigger so that only creatures
of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph
could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set
conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph,
such as those who say a certain password.
  Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a
60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10

minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each
creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is
targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the

Duration: Instantaneous

You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each
creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from you
makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, a creature takes 2d8 Thunder damage and is
pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save,
a creature takes half as much damage only.
  In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely
within the Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you,
and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet.

A 10-foot Emanation springs into existence around
you and remains stationary for the duration. The
spell fails when you cast it if the Emanation isn’t big
enough to fully encapsulate all creatures in its area.
  Creatures and objects within the Emanation
when you cast the spell can move through it freely.
All other creatures and objects are barred from
passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can’t be
cast through it, and the effects of such spells can’t
extend into it.
  The atmosphere inside the Emanation is comfort-
able and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Until
the spell ends, you can command the interior to have
Dim Light or Darkness (no action required). The Em-
anation is opaque from the outside and of any color
you choose, but it’s transparent from the inside.

within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at
least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of
movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the
location of all other trees of the same kind within
500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the
tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step
out of the tree you’re in. You appear in a spot of your
choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using
another 5 feet of movement. If you have no move-

Level 8 Conjuration (Druid)

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 1 mile
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 6 rounds

A wall of water springs into existence at a point you
choose within range. You can make the wall up to
300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The
wall lasts for the duration.
  When the wall appears, each creature in its area
makes a Strength saving throw, taking 6d10 Blud-
geoning damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one.
  At the start of each of your turns after the wall
appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it,
moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller
creature inside the wall or whose space the wall
enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength
saving throw or take 5d10 Bludgeoning damage. A
creature can take this damage only once per round.
At the end of the turn, the wall’s height is reduced
by 50 feet, and the damage the wall deals on later

rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0
feet in height, the spell ends.
  A creature caught in the wall can move by swim-
ming. Because of the wave’s force, though, the crea-
ture must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check
against your spell save DC to move at all. If it fails
the check, it can’t move. A creature that moves out

Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of string and of wood)
Duration: 1 hour

This spell creates an Invisible, mindless, shapeless,
Medium force that performs simple tasks at your
command until the spell ends. The servant springs
into existence in an unoccupied space on the
ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 Hit Point, and a
Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 Hit
Points, the spell ends.
  Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you
can mentally command the servant to move up to
15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can
perform simple tasks that a human could do, such as
fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes,
lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks.
Once you give the command, the servant performs
the task to the best of its ability until it completes
the task, then waits for your next command.
  If you command the servant to perform a task that
would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the

wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.
  When the wall appears, each creature in its area

damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
a successful one.
  One side of the wall, selected by you when you
cast this spell, deals 5d8 Fire damage to each crea-

An Invisible wall of force springs into existence at
a point you choose within range. The wall appears
in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or
vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating
or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a
hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up
to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up
of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must
be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of quartz)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within
range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome
or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can
shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square
panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another
panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts
for the duration.
  If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when
it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the
wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity
saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
  The wall is an object that can be damaged and
thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 Hit Points per
10-foot section, and it has Immunity to Cold, Poi-
son, and Psychic damage and Vulnerability to Fire
damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 Hit
Points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid
air in the space the wall occupied.
  A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air
for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution
saving throw, taking 5d6 Cold damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Level 5 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a cube of granite)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into exis-
tence at a point you choose within range. The wall
is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-
10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with
another panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-
by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.
  If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when
it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the
wall (you choose which side). If a creature would
be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall
and another solid surface), that creature can make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its
Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no lon-
ger enclosed by the wall.
  The wall can have any shape you desire, though it
can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object.
The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on a firm
foundation. It must, however, merge with and be
solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can
use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
  If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length,
you must halve the size of each panel to create sup-
ports. You can crudely shape the wall to create bat-
tlements and the like.
  The wall is an object made of stone that can be
damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15
and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has
Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing
a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might cause
connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.
  If you maintain your Concentration on this spell
for its full duration, the wall becomes permanent
and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disap-

diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick.
The wall blocks line of sight.
  When the wall appears, each creature in its area
makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Pierc-
ing damage on a failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one.
  A creature can move through the wall, albeit
slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature
moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of
movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature
enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn
there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw,
taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or half
as much damage on a successful one. A creature

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid
surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand,
or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (crea-
tures crossing molten lava can still take damage
from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures of your
choice within range gain this ability for the duration.
  An affected target must take a Bonus Action to
pass from the liquid’s surface into the liquid itself
and vice versa, but if the target falls into the liquid,
the target passes through the surface into the liquid

Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point
within range. The webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for
the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain, and the
area within them is Lightly Obscured.
  If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid
masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across
a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself,
and the spell ends at the start of your next turn.
Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5
feet.
  The first time a creature enters the webs on a
turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained con-
dition while in the webs or until it breaks free.
  A creature Restrained by the webs can take an
action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against
your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer
Restrained.
  The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs
exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4

Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius
Sphere centered on a point within range makes a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target
takes 10d10 Psychic damage and has the Frightened

Level 6 Transmutation (Druid)

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a candle)
Duration: 8 hours

You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice
within range assume gaseous forms for the du-
ration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this
cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and
can hover; it has Immunity to the Prone condition;
and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and
Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take
in this form are the Dash action or a Magic action to
begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes
1 minute, during which the target has the Stunned
condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert
to cloud form, which also requires a Magic action
followed by a 1-minute transformation.
  If a target is in cloud form and flying when the ef-
fect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for
1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t

Level 3 Evocation (Druid, Ranger)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a fan and a feather)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a
point you choose within range. You can make the
wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot
thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose
so long as it makes one continuous path along the
ground. The wall lasts for the duration.
  When the wall appears, each creature in its area
makes a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 Blud-
geoning damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one.
  The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other
gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or
objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, light-
weight materials brought into the wall fly upward.
Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles
launched at targets behind the wall are deflected
upward and miss automatically. Boulders hurled by
Giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are
unaffected. Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass
through it.

Wish

 is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By

simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.
  The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other
spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you
don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that
spell, including costly components. The spell simply
takes effect.
  Alternatively, you can create one of the following

effects of your choice:

 You create one object of up to
25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The
object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimen-
sion, and it appears in an unoccupied space that
you can see on the ground.

can see Resistance to one damage type that you
choose. This Resistance is permanent.

 You grant up to ten creatures you
can see immunity to a single spell or other magi-
cal effect for 8 hours.

Sudden Learning.

 You replace one of your feats with
another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all
the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of
the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a pre-
requisite for any of your other feats or features.

Roll Redo.

 You undo a single recent event by forcing
a reroll of any die roll made within the last round
Wish
(including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to
accommodate the new result. For example, a
spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a
foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made
with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose
whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

Reshape Reality.

 You may wish for something not

included in any of the other effects. To do so, state
your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The
GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in
such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater
the likelihood that something goes wrong. This
spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might
be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an
unforeseen consequence as a result of how you
worded the wish. For example, wishing that a
villain were dead might propel you forward in
time to a period when that villain is no longer
alive, effectively removing you from the game.

175

Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or
an Artifact might instantly transport you to the
presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish
is granted and its effects have consequences for a
whole community, region, or world, you are likely
to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect
a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly in-
tervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft
the wish in a particular way. If your wish would

Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against de-
ception in a 15-foot-radius Sphere centered on a
point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature
that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma sav-
ing throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a
deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether
a creature succeeds or fails on this save.
  An affected creature is aware of the spell and
can avoid answering questions to which it would
normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be
evasive yet must be truthful.
