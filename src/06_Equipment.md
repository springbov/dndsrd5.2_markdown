Coins

Characters often find coins on their adventures
and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other
businesses. Coins come in different denominations
based on the relative worth of their material. The
Coin Values table lists coins and how much they’re
worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game’s
main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are
worth 1 Gold Piece.
  A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty
Coin Values
coins weigh a pound.

each weapon, as well as the following details:

 Every weapon falls into a category: Sim-
ple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually
tied to one of these categories. For example, you
might have proficiency with Simple weapons.

Melee or Ranged.

 A weapon is classified as either

Damage.

Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to at-
tack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged
weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
 The table lists the amount of damage a

in the Properties column. Each property is de-
fined in the “Properties” section.

 Each weapon has a mastery property,

which is defined in the “Mastery Properties” sec-
tion. To use that property, you must have a feature
that lets you use it.
sEllinG EquipMEnt
Equipment fetches half its cost when sold. In con-
trast, trade goods and valuables—like gems and art
objects—retain their full value in the marketplace.
“Magic Items” has prices for magic items.

Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have
proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to
an attack roll you make with it. A player character’s
features can provide weapon proficiencies. A mon-
Properties
ster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.

Here are definitions of the properties in the Proper-
Ammunition
ties column of the Weapons table.

You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition
property to make a ranged attack only if you have
ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition
required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each
attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing
the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a
free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a
fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the
ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the
Finesse
rest is lost.

When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use
your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier
for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the
Heavy
same modifier for both rolls.

You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy
weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength
score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and
Light
your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.

When you take the Attack action on your turn and
attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra
attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn.
That extra attack must be made with a different
Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modi-
fier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modi-
fier is negative. For example, you can attack with a
Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other
using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you
don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the
damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modi-
fier is negative.

System Reference Document 5.2Loading

Cleave

You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a
Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus
Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the
Range
number of attacks you can normally make.

A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after
the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range
lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal
range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long
range. When attacking a target beyond normal
range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You
Reach
can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you
attack with it, as well as when determining your
Thrown
reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can
throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and
you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If
the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability
modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you
Two-Handed
use for a melee attack with that weapon.

A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when
Versatile
you attack with it.

A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with
the property. The weapon deals that damage when
Mastery Properties
used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Each weapon has a mastery property, which is us-
able only by a character who has a feature, such as
Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the
character. The properties are defined below.

iMprovisEd wEapons
If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan,
or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “Improvised
Weapons” in “Rules Glossary.” Also see those rules
if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using
a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.

If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using
this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with
the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet
of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit,
the second creature takes the weapon’s damage,
but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage
unless that modifier is negative. You can make this
Graze
extra attack only once per turn.

If your attack roll with this weapon misses a crea-
ture, you can deal damage to that creature equal
to the ability modifier you used to make the attack
roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the
weapon, and the damage can be increased only by
Nick
increasing the ability modifier.

When you make the extra attack of the Light prop-
erty, you can make it as part of the Attack action in-
stead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra
Push
attack only once per turn.

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push
the creature up to 10 feet straight away from your-
Sap
self if it is Large or smaller.

If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature
has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the
Slow
start of your next turn.

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal
damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet un-
til the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit
more than once by weapons that have this property,
Topple
the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10 feet.

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force
the creature to make a Constitution saving throw
(DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the
attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed
Vex
save, the creature has the Prone condition.

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal dam-
age to the creature, you have Advantage on your
next attack roll against that creature before the end
of your next turn.

table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well
Category.
as the following details:

 Every type of armor falls into a category:
Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines
how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as
shown in the table).

Armor Class (AC).

 The table’s Armor Class column

tells you what your base AC is when you wear a
type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather
Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity
modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.

Strength.

 If the table shows a Strength score in the

Strength column for an armor type, that armor
reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the
wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher
than the listed score.

Stealth.

 If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the

Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has
Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Armor

Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only
those with training can use them effectively, as
explained below. A character’s class and other fea-
tures determine the character’s armor training.
A monster has training with any armor in its stat
Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor
block.

If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack
training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20
Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you
Shield
can’t cast spells.

You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if
One at a Time
you have training with it.

A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time
and wield only one Shield at a time.

escapes. The target succeeds automatically if it is
Huge or larger.

of it must take an action to make a DC 10 Strength
(Athletics) check, freeing the Restrained creature
on a success. Destroying the Net (AC 10; 5 HP; Im-
munity to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic dam-

Spikes, Iron (1 GP)

Iron Spikes come in bundles of ten. As a Utilize
action, you can use a blunt object, such as a Light
Hammer, to hammer a spike into wood, earth, or a
similar material. You can do so to jam a door shut or
Spyglass (1,000 GP)
to then tie a Rope or Chain to the Spike.

A Waterskin holds up to 4 pints. If you don’t drink
sufficient water, you risk dehydration (see “Rules

A mount can help you move more quickly through
the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry
gear that would otherwise slow you down. The
Mounts and Other Animals table shows each ani-
mal’s carrying capacity. See “Monsters” for the ani-
Mounts and Cargo
mals’ stat blocks.

An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or
wagon can move weight up to five times its base
carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehi-
cle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, add
Barding
their carrying capacities together.

Barding is armor designed for a mount. Any type
of armor on the Armor table in “Equipment” can

100

be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the
Saddles
normal cost, and it weighs twice as much.

other equipment needed to use the saddle. A Mil-
itary Saddle gives Advantage on any ability check
you make to remain mounted. An Exotic Saddle is

A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half
speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships
can’t move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats
and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going
downstream, add the speed of the current (typically
3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These
vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant cur-
rent, but they can be pulled upstream by draft an-
imals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and
weighs 100 pounds.

Magic Items

  The
 spell is the fastest way to reveal an
item’s properties. Alternatively, you can focus on
one magic item during a Short Rest while being in
physical contact with the item. At the end of the
rest, you learn its properties and how to use them
(but not any curse the item might bear).
  Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its prop-
erties. The command word to activate a ring might
be etched inside the band, or a feathered design
might hint that it’s a

experimentation. For example, if your character

Some magic items require a creature to form a
bond—called Attunement—with them before the
creature can use an item’s magical properties. With-
out becoming attuned to an item that requires At-
tunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits un-
less its description states otherwise. For example, a
magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the
benefits of a normal Shield if you aren’t attuned to
Attune during a Short Rest
it, but none of its magical properties.

Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short
Rest focused on only that item while being in physi-
cal contact with it (this can’t be the same Short Rest
used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can
take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon),
meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate
activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the At-
tunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the
Short Rest, you’re attuned to the magic item and can
No More Than Three Items
access its full magical capabilities.

Adventures hold the promise—but not a guaran-
tee—of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic
items are detailed in “Magic Items” later in this doc-
ument. Here’s what you need to know about using
Identifying a Magic Item
magic items.

You can be attuned to no more than three magic
items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth
item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item
first. Additionally, you can’t attune to more than

one copy of an item. For example, you can’t attune to

more than one

 at a time.

Some magic items are indistinguishable from their
nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspic-
uously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to

Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer
satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item
has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24
hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to

by spending another Short Rest focused on the item
Wearing and Wielding Items
unless the item is cursed.

Using a magic item’s properties might mean wear-
ing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn
must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on
feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head,
and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned,
a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about
the shoulders. A weapon must be held.
  In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be
worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build.
Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or

they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

You can’t wear more than one of certain magic
items. You can’t normally wear more than one pair
of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair
of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear,
Paired Items
or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions.

Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers,
gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only

if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a

Crafting Nonmagical Items
gains no benefit from either.

To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw ma-
terials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If
you meet the requirements, you make the item, and
Tools
you can use it or sell it at its normal price.

The “Tools” section of “Equipment” lists which tools
are required to make certain items. The GM assigns
required tools for items not listed there.
  You must use the required tool to make an item
and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who
Raw Materials
helps you must also have proficiency with it.

To make an item, you need raw materials worth
half its purchase cost (round down). For example,
you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate
Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines
Time
whether appropriate raw materials are available.

To determine how many days (working 8 hours a
day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase
cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For

103

example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Cross-
bow, which sells for 50 GP.
  If an item requires multiple days, the days needn’t
be consecutive.
  Characters can combine their efforts to shorten
the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create
an item by the number of characters working on it.
Normally, only one other character can assist you,

but the GM might allow more assistants.

Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money
based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell
Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you
must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple
Prerequisites for the Scribe
days, those days needn’t be consecutive.

To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the
Arcana skill or with Calligrapher’s Supplies and
have the spell prepared on each day of the inscrip-
tion. You must also have at hand any Material com-
ponents required by the spell; if the spell consumes
its Material components, they are consumed only
when you complete the scroll. The scroll’s spell uses
