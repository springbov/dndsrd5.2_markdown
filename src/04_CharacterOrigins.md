Character Species

When you choose your character’s species, you
determine whether your character is a human or a
member of a fantastical species, such as dragonborn
or gnome.
  The peoples of the multiverse hail from different
worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms.
A player character’s species is the set of game traits
that an adventurer gains from being one of those
life forms.
  Some species can trace their origin to a single
world, plane of existence, or god, while other spe-
cies first appeared in multiple realms at once.
Whatever a species’ genesis, its members have
spread across the multiverse and contribute to
many different cultures.
  Members of most species live for about 80 years,
with exceptions noted in the text about the spe-
cies in “Character Origins.” Regardless of life span,
members of all species reach physical maturity at
about the same age. Your character can be any age

that isn’t beyond their species’ normal life span.

Creature Type
A species includes the following parts.

A character’s species determines the character’s
creature type, which is described in “Rules Glos-
sary.” Every species in “Character Origins” is Hu-
manoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in

Your character’s species determines the character’s

Each species gives a character special traits—
unique characteristics based on the species’ physi-

 When you take the Attack action

on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks
with an exhalation of magical energy in either a
15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide
(choose the shape each time). Each creature in that
area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus
your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of
the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry
trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as
much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when
you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and
17 (4d10).
