uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra dam-
age’s type is the same as the weapon’s type.
  You don’t need Advantage on the attack roll if at
least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target,
the ally doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition,
and you don’t have Disadvantage on the attack roll.
  The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue
levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the

d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak
Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you
can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects.
Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of
Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the
effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the
effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage
is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect,
remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before
rolling.
  If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw,
the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and
Proficiency Bonus.

Poison (Cost: 1d6).

 You add a toxin to your strike,

forcing the target to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned
condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its
turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending
the effect on itself on a success.
  To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner’s Kit
on your person.

Trip (Cost: 1d6).

 If the target is Large or smaller,

it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have

tack’s damage against you (round down).

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dan-
gers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows
you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only
half damage, you instead take no damage if you
succeed on the saving throw and only half damage
if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the
Incapacitated condition.

You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when
you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost

for each effect.

You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack
deviously. The following effects are now among
your Cunning Strike options.

Daze (Cost: 2d6).

 The target must succeed on a

Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can
do only one of the following: move or take an action

or a Bonus Action.

 The target must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Uncon-
scious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any
damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on

You’re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another

You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when
you need to. If you fail a D20 Test, you can turn the
roll into a 20.

until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
