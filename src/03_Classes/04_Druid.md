  The number of spells on your list increases as you

column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Druid spell list until the number of spells on your

spells must be of a level for which you have spell

of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
  If another Druid feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Druid spells for you.

In addition, you choose whether your equipment

the new form to wear a piece of equipment based
on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment
doesn’t change size or shape to match the new
form, and any equipment that the new form can’t
wear must either fall to the ground or merge with
the form. Equipment that merges with the form
has no effect while you’re in that form.

Level 3: Land’s Aid

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild
Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself.
Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns
appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere cen-
tered on that point. Each creature of your choice in
the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw
against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
a successful one. One creature of your choice in that
area regains 2d6 Hit Points.
  The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when
Level 6: Natural Recovery
you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).

You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have
prepared from your Circle Spells feature without
expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long
Rest before you do so again.
  In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can
choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell
slots can have a combined level that is equal to or
less than half your Druid level (round up), and none
of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level
6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of
spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level
2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots.
Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you
Level 10: Nature’s Ward

You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you
have Resistance to a damage type associated with

as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.

Level 14: Nature’s Sanctuary

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild
Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear
in a 15-foot Cube on the ground within 120 feet of
yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you
have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and
your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and
your allies gain the current Resistance of your Na-
ture’s Ward while there.
  As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to
60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.
