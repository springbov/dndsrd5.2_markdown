Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You have a limited well of physical and mental
stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action,
you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10
plus your Fighter level.
  You can use this feature twice. You regain one
expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
Rest.
  When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain
more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Wind column of the Fighter Features table.

Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Mar-
tial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish
a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and
change one of those weapon choices.
  When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain
the ability to use the mastery properties of more
kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery
Level 2: Action Surge
column of the Fighter Features table.

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits
for a moment. On your turn, you can take one addi-
tional action, except the Magic action.
  Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again
until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Starting at
level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only
Level 2: Tactical Mind
once on a turn.

You have a mind for tactics on and off the battle-
field. When you fail an ability check, you can expend
a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward
success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll
1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check,
potentially turning it into a success. If the check still
Level 3: Fighter Subclass
fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.

You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The
Champion subclass is detailed after this class’s de-
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest
of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Fighter level or lower.

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Fighter levels

without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a
bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the
new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until
you finish a Long Rest.
  You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest
starting at level 13 and three times before a Long
Level 9: Tactical Master
Rest starting at level 17.

When you attack with a weapon whose mastery
property you can use, you can replace that property
Level 11: Two Extra Attacks
with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack.

You can attack three times instead of once when-
Level 13: Studied Attacks
ever you take the Attack action on your turn.

You study your opponents and learn from each at-
tack you make. If you make an attack roll against a
creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next
attack roll against that creature before the end of

your next turn.

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
