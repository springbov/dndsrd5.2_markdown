those options.

Sorcerer Subclass: Draconic
Sorcery
Breathe the Magic of Dragons

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon.
Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed
some of its magical power to you or your ancestor.
You might have absorbed magic from a site infused
with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a
treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was
steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a
Level 3: Draconic Resilience
dragon for an ancestor.

The magic in your body manifests physical traits
of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum in-
creases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you
gain another Sorcerer level.
  Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like
scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base
Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Cha-
risma modifiers.

Level 6: Elemental Affinity

Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage
type associated with dragons. Choose one of those
types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.
  You have Resistance to that damage type, and
when you cast a spell that deals damage of that
type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one

damage roll of that spell.

As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to
appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or
until you dismiss them (no action required). For the
duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.
  Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again

cery Points (no action required) to restore your use
of it.Level 18: Dragon Companion

  Whenever you start casting the spell, you can
modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If
you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for
that casting.
