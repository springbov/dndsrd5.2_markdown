contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or

appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome
or a collection of vellum bound with twine.

 You prepare the list

of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast

your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots.
  The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional Wizard spells
until the number of spells on your list matches the
number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots. For example, if
you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells
can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combi-
nation, chosen from your spellbook.

You can regain some of your magical energy by
studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short
Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to re-
cover. The spell slots can have a combined level
equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round
up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher.
For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can re-
cover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regain-
ing either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell
slots.

While studying magic, you also specialized in an-

skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, His-
tory, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion.
Level 3: Wizard Subclass
You have Expertise in the chosen skill.

You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The
Evoker subclass is detailed after this class’s de-
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest

The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain
levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you
might find other spells during your adventures that
you can add to the book. You could discover a Wiz-
ard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy
it into your spellbook.
  Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find
a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your
spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you
have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the
transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. After-
ward you can prepare the spell like the other spells
in your spellbook.
  Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from
your spellbook into another book. This is like copy-
ing a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since
you already know how to cast the spell. You need
spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the
copied spell.
  If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same
procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you
have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the
remainder of the new book requires you to find new
spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a
backup spellbook.

a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

Wizard Subclass: Evoker
Create Explosive Elemental Effects

Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful
elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame,
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning
acid. Some Evokers find employment in military
forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from
afar. Others use their power to protect others, while
some seek their own gain.

Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation
school, each of which must be no higher than level 2,
and add them to your spellbook for free.
  In addition, whenever you gain access to a new
level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wiz-
ard spell from the Evocation school to your spell-
book for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for
Level 3: Potent Cantrip
which you have spell slots.

Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that
avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a can-
trip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll
or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the
cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the
Level 6: Sculpt Spells
cantrip.

You can create pockets of relative safety within the
effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evoca-
tion spell that affects other creatures that you can
see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1
plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automat-
ically succeed on their saving throws against the
spell, and they take no damage if they would nor-
Level 10: Empowered Evocation
mally take half damage on a successful save.

Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evoca-
tion school, you can add your Intelligence modifier
Level 14: Overchannel
to one damage roll of that spell.

You can increase the power of your spells. When
you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5
that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage
with that spell on the turn you cast it.
  The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse ef-
fect. If you use this feature again before you finish a
Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each
level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it.
This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.
  Each time you use this feature again before finish-
ing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level
increases by 1d12.
