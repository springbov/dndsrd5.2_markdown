  The number of spells on your list increases as you

column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your
list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
  If another Cleric feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as

Cleric Subclass: Life Domain
Soothe the Hurts of the World

The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that
helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who
tap into this domain are masters of healing, using
that life force to cure many hurts.
  Existence itself relies on the positive energy as-
sociated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any
religious tradition might choose it. This domain is
particularly associated with agricultural deities,
gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and
community. Religious orders of healing also seek
Level 3: Disciple of Life
the magic of this domain.

When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit
Points to a creature, that creature regains addi-
tional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The
additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s
level.

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you
always have certain spells ready. When you reach
a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells
table, you thereafter always have the listed spells
Life Domain Spells
prepared.

Level 3: Preserve Life

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol
and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke
healing energy that can restore a number of Hit
Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose
Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which
can include you), and divide those Hit Points among
them. This feature can restore a creature to no

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as
well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell
slot that restores Hit Points to one or more crea-
tures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points
Level 17: Supreme Healing
equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.

When you would normally roll one or more dice to
restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Chan-
nel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; in-
stead use the highest number possible for each die.
For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a
creature with a spell, you restore 12.
