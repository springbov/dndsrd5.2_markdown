have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
  Once within the next hour when the creature fails
a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspira-
tion die and add the number rolled to the d20, po-
tentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic
Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.

Number of Uses.

 You can confer a Bardic Inspira-
tion die a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all ex-
pended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die
changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as

Bard Subclass:
College of Lore
Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge

Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and se-
crets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes,
mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s mem-
bers gather in libraries and universities to share
their lore with one another. They also meet at festi-
vals or affairs of state, where they can expose cor-
ruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important
Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies
figures of authority.

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract,
confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and com-
petence of others. When a creature that you can see
within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or
succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can
take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic
Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and
subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll,
reducing the damage or potentially turning the suc-
Level 6: Magical Discoveries
cess into a failure.

You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can
come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or
any combination thereof (see a class’s section for its
spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a
spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the
Bard Features table.
  You always have the chosen spells prepared, and
whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one
of the spells with another spell that meets these
Level 14: Peerless Skill
requirements.

When you make an ability check or attack roll and
fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration;
roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number
rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into
a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t
expended.
