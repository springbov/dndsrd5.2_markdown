Warlock Subclass: Fiend Patron
Make a Deal with the Lower Planes

Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of
perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon
lord, an archdevil, or another fiend that is especially
mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption
or destruction of all things, ultimately including
you—and your path is defined by the extent to
Level 3: Dark One’s Blessing
which you strive against those aims.

When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain
Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma mod-
ifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Tempo-
rary Hit Point). You also gain this benefit if someone
else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 Hit
Level 3: Fiend Spells
Points.

The magic of your patron ensures you always have
certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock
level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereaf-
ter always have the listed spells prepared.

You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate
in your favor. When you make an ability check or a
saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10
to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but
before any of the roll’s effects occur.
  You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but
you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain
Level 10: Fiendish Resilience
all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Choose one damage type, other than Force, when-
ever you finish a Short or Long Rest. You have Resis-
tance to that damage type until you choose a differ-
Level 14: Hurl Through Hell
ent one with this feature.

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an
attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the
target through the Lower Planes. The target must
succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your
spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles
through a nightmare landscape. The target takes
8d10 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the
Incapacitated condition until the end of your next
turn, when it returns to the space it previously oc-
cupied or the nearest unoccupied space.
  Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a
Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore
your use of it.
