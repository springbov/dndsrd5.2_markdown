You can channel divine energy directly from the

start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is

which effect from this class to create.
  You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice.
You regain one of its expended uses when you finish

A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of
conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible.
Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.
  A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks
absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of pen-
itence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgive-
ness, the Paladin starts fresh.
  If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath,
talk to your GM. Your Paladin should probably take a
more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class
and adopt another one.

  As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature
(which could be yourself) and draw power from the
pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to
that creature, up to the maximum amount remain-
ing in the pool.
  You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of
healing power to remove the Poisoned condition
from the creature; those points don’t also restore

Paladin Subclass: Oath of Devotion
Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals
of justice and order. These Paladins meet the ar-
chetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold
themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and
some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the
world to the same standards.
  Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods
of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the
measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as
their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings
into their helmets or coats of arms.
  These paladins share the following tenets:

•
•
Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells
•

  Let your word be your promise.
  Protect the weak and never fear to act.
  Let your honorable deeds be an example.

The magic of your oath ensures you always have
certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level
specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you

When you take the Attack action, you can expend

Melee weapon that you are holding with positive
energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature
again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack
rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus
of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to
deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.
  The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot
radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.
  You can end this effect early (no action required).
This effect also ends if you aren’t carrying the

You and your allies have Immunity to the Charmed
