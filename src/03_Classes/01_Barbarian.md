 The Rage lasts until the end of your

next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor
or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage
is still active on your next turn, you can extend
the Rage for another round by doing one of the
following:

•  Make an attack roll against an enemy.
•  Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
•  Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end
of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to
Level 1: Unarmored Defense
10 minutes.

While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Ar-
mor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Consti-
tution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
this benefit.

Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Mar-
tial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Great-
axes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long
Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one
of those weapon choices.
  When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain
the ability to use the mastery properties of more
kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery
Level 2: Danger Sense
column of the Barbarian Features table.

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as
they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge
perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving

throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.

You can throw aside all concern for defense to at-
tack with increased ferocity. When you make your
first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to at-
tack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on at-
tack rolls using Strength until the start of your next

turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage
Level 3: Barbarian Subclass
during that time.

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The
Path of the Berserker subclass is detailed after this
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization
that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels.
For the rest of your career, you gain each of your
subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level
Level 3: Primal Knowledge
or lower.

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice
from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.
  In addition, while your Rage is active, you can
channel primal power when you attempt certain
tasks; whenever you make an ability check using
one of the following skills, you can make it as a
Strength check even if it normally uses a differ-
ent ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception,
Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your
Strength represents primal power coursing through

you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian lev-

els 8, 12, and 16.

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t

Your instincts are so honed that you have Advan-

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your
Level 9: Brutal Strike
Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Ad-
vantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your
choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t
have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the
target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type
dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can
cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You
have the following effect options.

Forceful Blow.

The target is pushed 15 feet

straight away from you. You can then move up to
half your Speed straight toward the target without
provoking Opportunity Attacks.

System Reference Document 5.2

  Hamstring Blow.

Level 20: Primal Champion

The target’s Speed is reduced by
15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can
be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—
Level 11: Relentless Rage
the most recent one.

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous
wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage
is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC
10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your
Hit Points instead change to a number equal to
twice your Barbarian level.
  Each time you use this feature after the first, the
DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long
Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike
Rest, the DC resets to 10.

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The
following effects are now among your Brutal Strike
options.

Staggering Blow.

 The target has Disadvantage on

the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make
Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next
turn.

Sundering Blow.

 Before the start of your next

turn, the next attack roll made by another creature
against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An
Level 15: Persistent Rage
attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all ex-
pended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage
in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a
Long Rest.
  In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts
for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything
to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends
early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just
Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike
the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to
2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal
Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike
Level 18: Indomitable Might
feature.

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving
throw is less than your Strength score, you can use
Level 19: Epic Boon
that score in place of the total.

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Irresistible Offense is recommended.

You embody primal power. Your Strength and Con-
Barbarian Subclass:
stitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.
Path of the Berserker
Channel Rage into Violent Fury

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker
direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their
path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in
the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize
Level 3: Frenzy
and empower them.

If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active,
you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on
your turn with a Strength-based attack. To deter-
mine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal
to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together.
The damage has the same type as the weapon or
Level 6: Mindless Rage
Unarmed Strike used for the attack.

You have Immunity to the Charmed and Fright-
ened conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re
Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage,
Level 10: Retaliation
the condition ends on you.

When you take damage from a creature that is
within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to
make one melee attack against that creature, using
Level 14: Intimidating Presence
a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others
with your menacing presence and primal power.
When you do so, each creature of your choice in a
30-foot Emanation originating from you must make
a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength
modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save,
a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 min-
ute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature’s
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the ef-
fect on itself on a success.
  Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use
of your Rage (no action required) to restore your
use of it.
