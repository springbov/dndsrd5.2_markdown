You’ll record the main details of your character on

“Character Creation” for more information.

Your class might give you training with certain
categories of armor. Note your armor training on
your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of
armor means you can wear that armor effectively,
gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of

armor are described in “Equipment.”

Determining your character’s origin involves choos-
ing a background, a species, and two languages.
  A character’s background represents the place
and occupation that were most formative for the
character. The combination of background, species,
and languages provides fertile soil for your imagi-

Choose your character’s background, and write it on
your character sheet. You can choose any of the back-
grounds detailed in “Character Origins,” and your GM
might offer additional backgrounds as options.
  The background you choose influences step 3,
when you determine your character’s ability scores.
If you’re having trouble choosing, the Ability Scores

Note Proficiencies.

 Your background gives profi-

information on your character sheet.
  Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your
class description in “Classes” and note the proficien-

your species’ traits.
  Your character’s size and Speed are determined
by the character’s species; record these in the ap-
propriate places on your character sheet as well
Imagine Your Past and Present
(you may write just the first letter of your size).

Let your character’s background and species inspire
how you imagine their past. That past fed into the
character’s present. With that in mind, consider an-
swers to the following questions as your character:

•  Who raised you?
•  Who was your dearest childhood friend?
•  Did you grow up with a pet?
•  Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
•  Did you join an organization, such as a guild or re-

ligion? If so, are you still a member of it?

•  What elements of your past inspire you to go on

adventures now?

Choose Languages

Your character knows at least three languages:
Common plus two languages you roll or choose
from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a
language means your character can communicate in
it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features
might also give you languages.
  The Standard Languages table lists languages that
are widespread in the setting. Every player charac-
ter knows Common. The other standard languages
originated with the first members of the most
prominent species in the setting and have since

Step 3: Ability Scores

To determine your character’s ability scores, you
first generate a set of six numbers using the instruc-
tions below and then assign them to your six abili-
ties. “Playing the Game” explains what each ability
means.

primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.
  If you’re using the Standard Array option, consult
the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions
on where to assign scores for your character’s class.
The table puts the highest scores in a class’s main
abilities. If you used a different method to gener-

  The game assumes that player characters aren’t of
an evil alignment. Check with your GM before mak-

A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).

also space to track Death Saving Throws.

Hit Point Dice.

 Your class’s description tells you
the die type of your character’s Hit Point Dice (or

While going on adventures, your character gains ex-

character who reaches a specified Experience Point
total advances in capability. This advancement is
called gaining a level.
  The Character Advancement table lists the XP
you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency
Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP

Gaining a Level

1: Choose a Class.
When you gain a level, follow these steps:

Most characters advance in the
same class. However, you might decide to gain a
level in another class using the rules in the “Mul-
ticlassing” section.

2: Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice.

 Each time

you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die.
Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to
the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your
Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can
use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points
by Class table.

3: Record New Class Features.

 Look at your class
features table in “Classes,” and note the features
you gain at your new level in that class. Make any
choices offered by a new feature.

4: Adjust Proficiency Bonus.

 A character’s Pro-

ficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as
shown in the Character Advancement table and
your class features table in “Classes.” When your
Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the
numbers on your character sheet that include

your Proficiency Bonus.

 If you choose a feat

that increases one or more of your ability scores,
your ability modifier also changes if the new
score is an even number. When that happens, ad-
just all the numbers on your character sheet that
use that ability modifier. When your Constitution
modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum
increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
For example, if a character reaches level 8 and
increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18,
the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The
character’s Hit Point maximum then increases by
8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reach-
Tiers of Play
ing level 8.

With each new level, characters acquire new ca-
pabilities that equip them to handle greater chal-
lenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of
the game also changes, and the stakes of the cam-
paign get higher. It’s helpful to think of a character’s
(and a campaign’s) arc in terms of four tiers of play,

Bonus Feats at LeveL 20
A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after
characters reach level 20 to provide greater power
to characters who have no more levels to gain. With
this approach, each character gains one feat of their
choice for every 30,000 XP the character earns
above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially
appropriate for these bonus feats, but a player can
choose any feat for which their level 20 character
qualifies.

.

in the “Level Advancement” section
 You begin with
the minimum amount of XP required to reach your
starting level. For example, if the GM starts you at
Starting Equipment
level 10, you have 64,000 XP.

The GM decides whether your character starts with
more than the standard equipment for a level 1
character, possibly even one or more magic items.
The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a
guide for the GM.
  Also, check with your GM about what equipment
is available for you to buy with your starting money.
For example, the firearms described in “Equipment”
are too expensive for level 1 characters, but they
might be available for purchase if your GM allows
them.Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple
classes. With this rule, you have the option of gain-
ing a level in a new class whenever you advance in
level instead of gaining a level in your current class.
Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes
to realize a character concept that might not be re-
Prerequisites
flected in a single class.

To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of
at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class
and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian
who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must
have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher,

those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.

The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on
your total character level, not your level in a partic-
ular class, as shown in the Character Advancement
table in “Character Creation.” For example, if you
are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain
enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your
second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a
Cleric.Hit Points and Hit Point Dice

You gain the Hit Points from your new class as de-
scribed for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit
Points for a class only when your total character
level is 1.
  Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your
classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice
are the same die type, you can pool them together.
For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have
a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5
Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes
give you Hit Dice of different types, track them sep-
arately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin,
for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10
Proficiency Bonus
Hit Dice.

Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total char-
acter level, not your level in a particular class, as
shown in the Character Advancement table. For
example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue,
you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 charac-

ter, which is +3.

When you gain your first level in a class other than
your initial class, you gain only some of the new
class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each
Class Features
class’s description in “Classes.”

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its fea-
tures for that level. A few features have additional
rules when you’re multiclassing. Check the infor-
mation about multiclassing included in each of your
classes’ descriptions.
  Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting,
and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give
Armor Class
you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.

If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor
Class, you can benefit from only one at a time.
For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s

If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than
one class, the features don’t stack. You can’t make
more than two attacks with this feature unless you
have a feature that says you can (such as the Fight-
er’s Two Extra Attacks feature).
  Similarly, the Warlock’s Thirsting Blade invo-
cation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature
with your pact weapon, doesn’t give you additional
Spellcasting
attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on
your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes
and partly on your individual levels in those classes.

were a single-classed member of that class. If you
are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example,
you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you
can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as
well as four Sorcerer cantrips).
  Each spell you prepare is associated with one of
your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of
that class when you cast the spell.

Cantrips.

 If a cantrip of yours increases in power
at higher levels, the increase is based on your total
character level, not your level in a particular class,
unless the spell says otherwise.

Spell Slots.

You determine your available spell

slots by adding together the following:

•  All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer,

and Wizard classes

•  Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and

Ranger classes

Then look up this total level in the Level column of
the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for
that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from
any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.
  This table might give you spell slots of a higher
level than the spells you prepare. You can use those
Burning Hands
slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a
,
lower-level spell that you cast, like
has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level,
you can use the enhanced effect as normal.
  For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3
Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when de-
termining your spell slots, counting all your levels
as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown

System Reference Document 5.2

in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four
level 1 spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3
slots. However, you can’t prepare any level 3 spells,
nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You
can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the
spells you do prepare—and potentially enhance

their effects.

 If you have the Pact Magic feature

from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature,
you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic
to cast spells you have prepared from classes with
the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell
slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast
Multiclass Spellcaster:
Warlock spells you have prepared.

Trinkets

When you make your character, you can roll once
on the Trinkets table to gain a Tiny trinket, a simple
item lightly touched by mystery. The GM might also
use this table. It can help stock a room in a dungeon
or fill a creature’s pockets.
