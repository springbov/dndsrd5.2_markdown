# Rules Glossary

Rules Definitions

Glossary Conventions

Ability Check
Here are definitions of various rules.

Tags in Brackets.
The glossary uses the following conventions:

 Some entries have a tag in brack-
ets after the entry’s name, as in “Attack [Action].”
A tag—Action, Area of Effect, Attitude, Condition,
or Hazard—indicates that a rule is part of a family
of rules. The tags also have glossary entries.

“You.”

 The game’s rules—in this glossary and else-

where—often talk about something happening
to you in the game world. That “you” refers to
the creature or object that the rule applies to in a
particular moment of play. For example, the “you”
in the Prone condition is a creature that currently

has that condition.

“See Also.”

 Some glossary entries include a
section that points to other entries in the glossary,
to other parts of this document, or both.

No Obsolete Terms.

 The glossary contains defini-

tions of current rules terms only. If you’re looking
for a term from an earlier version of the fifth edi-
tion rules, consult the index.

An ability check is a D20 Test that represents using
one of the six abilities—or a specific skill associated
with an ability—to overcome a challenge.
Ability Score and Modifier
“Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests” and “Proficiency”).

See also

A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dex-
terity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma—each of which has a corresponding mod-
ifier. Add the modifier when you make a D20 Test
with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks
you to do so.

An adventure is a series of encounters. A
story emerges through playing them.
Alignment
“Encounter.”

See also

A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). These factors al-
low for nine possible combinations, such as Lawful
Good and Neutral Evil.
Ally

A creature is your ally if it is a member of your ad-
venturing party, your friend, on your side in combat,
or a creature that the rules or the GM designates as
your ally.

Area of Effect

Attack Roll

The descriptions of many spells and other features
specify that they have an area of effect, which typ-
ically has one of six shapes. These shapes are de-
Cone
fined elsewhere in this glossary:
Cube

Cylinder
Emanation

Line
Sphere

See also

An area of effect has a point of origin, a location
from which the effect’s energy erupts. The rules for
each shape specify how to position its point of ori-
gin. If all straight lines extending from the point of
origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked,
that location isn’t included in the area of effect.
To block a line, an obstruction must provide Total
Cover.
  If the creator of an area of effect places it at an
unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall—
is between the creator and that point, the point
of origin comes into being on the near side of the
Armor Class
obstruction.

 “Cover.”

An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an
attack roll. AC represents how difficult it is to hit a
target.
  Your base AC calculation is 10 plus your Dexterity
modifier. If a rule gives you another base AC calcula-
tion, you choose which calculation to use; you can’t

Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain
category without the following drawbacks. If you
wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack train-

that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t
cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training with
it, you don’t gain its AC bonus.

Equipping and Unequipping Weapons.

When you take the Attack action, you can make one
attack roll with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

 You can

either equip or unequip one weapon when you make
an attack as part of this action. You do so either
before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon
before an attack, you don’t need to use it for that at-
tack. Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from
a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon in-
cludes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it.

Moving between Attacks.

 If you move on your

turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that
gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack
action, you can use some or all of that movement to
move between those attacks.

Damage Types and Objects.

 Objects have Immu-

decide that some damage types are more or less ef-
fective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning
damage works well for smashing things but not for
cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnera-

Challenge Rating

Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a
monster poses to a group of four player characters.
Compare a monster’s CR to the characters’ level. If
the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger. If the
CR is lower, the monster likely poses little threat.
But circumstances and the number of player charac-
ters can significantly alter how threatening a mon-
ster is in actual play. “Gameplay Toolbox” (“Combat

Some spells and other effects require Concentration
to remain active, as specified in their descriptions.
If the effect’s creator loses Concentration, the effect
ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the ef-

concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some
other duration. The creator can end Concentration

A condition is a temporary game state. The defini-
tion of a condition says how it affects its recipient,
and various rules define how to end a condition.

This glossary defines these conditions:
Charmed
Deafened
Exhaustion
Frightened

Grappled
Incapacitated
Invisible
Paralyzed
Petrified

Poisoned
Prone
Restrained
Stunned
Unconscious

A condition doesn’t stack with itself; a recipient
either has a condition or doesn’t. The Exhaustion
Cone [Area of Effect]
condition is an exception to that rule.

A Cone is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator
chooses. A Cone’s width at any point along its length
is equal to that point’s distance from the point of
origin. For example, a Cone is 15 feet wide at a point
along its length that is 15 feet from the point of
origin. The effect that creates a Cone specifies its
maximum length.
  A Cone’s point of origin isn’t included in the area
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

Cover

Cover provides a degree of protection to a target
behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of
which provides a different benefit to a target: Half
Cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws),
Three-Quarters Cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexter-
ity saving throws), and Total Cover (can’t be tar-

“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

A creature or an object that has a damage thresh-

amount of damage from a single attack or effect
equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in
which case it takes that entire instance of dam-
age. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the
damage threshold is superficial and doesn’t reduce
Hit Points. For example, if an object has a damage
threshold of 10, the object takes no damage if 9
damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to
exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11

“Flying.”

Spells and other effects sometimes create magical il-

  If an illusion manifests in space, the illusion is
insubstantial and weightless, yet it seems to be
affected by the environment as if the illusion were
real unless the effect that created it specifies oth-
erwise. For example, a visual illusion of a creature
casts shadows and reflections, and wind appears

the score by 5. If the creature has Disadvantage on

You take the Ready action to wait for a particular

  First, you decide what perceivable circumstance
will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the

 Some creatures have special

speeds, such as a Burrow Speed, Climb Speed, Fly

in this glossary. If you have more than one speed,
choose which one to use when you move; you can
switch between the speeds during your move.
Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already
moved from the new speed. The result determines
how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or
less, you can’t use the new speed during the current

Fly Speed of 40, you could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet,
and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more.

Changes to Your Speeds.

 If an effect increases or
decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed
you have increases or decreases by an equal amount
for the same duration. For example, if your Speed

 A stat block usually provides
both a static number and a die expression for each
instance of damage. For example, an attack might
deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. The GM deter-

Target

Tremorsense

A target is the creature or object targeted by an
attack roll, forced to make a saving throw by an
effect, or selected to receive the effects of a spell or
Telepathy
another phenomenon.

Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature
to communicate mentally with another creature
within a specified range. Unless a rule states other-
wise, the contacted creature doesn’t need to share a
language with the telepath to understand this com-
munication, but the contacted creature must be able
to understand at least one language or be telepathic
itself to understand.
  A telepath doesn’t need to see a contacted crea-
ture, and the telepath can start or end the telepathic
contact at any time (no action required). Telepathic
contact can’t be initiated and is immediately broken
if either the telepath or the other creature has the
Incapacitated condition. Telepathic contact is also
broken if the contacted creature is no longer within
the telepathy’s range or if the telepath contacts a
different creature within range.
  A creature without telepathy can receive tele-
pathic messages but can’t initiate a telepathic con-
versation. Once a telepathic conversation starts,
the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the
Teleportation
telepath until the telepathic connection ends.

Teleportation is a special kind of magical transpor-
tation. If you teleport, you disappear and reappear
elsewhere instantly, without moving through the
intervening space. This transportation doesn’t ex-
pend movement unless a rule tells you otherwise,
and teleportation never provokes Opportunity
Attacks.
  When you teleport, all the equipment you’re
wearing and carrying teleports with you. If you’re
touching another creature when you teleport, that
creature doesn’t teleport with you unless the tele-
portation effect says otherwise.
  If the destination space of your teleportation is
occupied by another creature or blocked by a solid
obstacle, you instead appear in the nearest unoccu-
pied space of your choice.
  The description of a teleportation effect tells you

A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the loca-

orsense and anything it is detecting are both in
contact with the same surface (such as the ground,
a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.
