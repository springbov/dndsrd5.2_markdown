and in this section.

A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge,
or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you
choose the creature’s size from those options. See
Creature Type
“Playing the Game” for information on size.

Each monster has a tag that identifies the type of
creature it is. Certain spells, magic items, class fea-
tures, and other effects in the game interact in spe-
cial ways with creatures of a particular type.

A monster might have one or more tags in parenthe-

categorization and have no rules of their own, but
Alignment
certain game effects might refer to them.

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is
a default suggestion of how to roleplay the monster,
inspired by its traditional role in the game or real-
world folklore. Change a monster’s alignment to
suit your storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment,
in particular, is an invitation for you to consider
whether an individual leans toward one of the other
alignments.

describes the nine align-

A monster’s Armor Class (AC) includes its natural
armor, Dexterity, gear, and other defenses. See
Initiative
“Playing the Game” for information on Armor Class.

The Initiative entry specifies the monster’s Initia-
tive modifier followed by the monster’s Initiative
score in parentheses. Use the modifier when you
roll to determine a monster’s Initiative. A monster’s
Initiative modifier is typically equal to its Dexterity
modifier, but some monsters have additional mod-
ifiers, such as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that
number.
  If you don’t want to roll a monster’s Initiative, use
the Initiative score as the monster’s Initiative in
combat. Initiative is further detailed in “Playing the
Game

.”

Hit Points

A monster’s Hit Points are presented as a number
followed by parentheses, where the monster’s Hit
Point Dice are provided, along with any contribu-
tion from its Constitution. Either use the number for
the monster’s Hit Points or roll the die expression in
parentheses to determine the monster’s Hit Points
randomly; don’t use both.
  A monster’s size typically determines the die used
to calculate its Hit Points, as shown in the Hit Dice

A monster’s Constitution modifier is multiplied by
the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result
is added to its Hit Points. For example, if a monster
has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit
Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 Hit Points (average 11).
Speed
  For more on Hit Points, see “Playing the Game

.”

The Speed entry specifies a monster’s Speed. Some
monsters have one or more of the following speeds:
Burrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these

specials speeds appear in “Rules Glossary

.”

throw modifiers. For more information on ability
Skills
scores and saving throws, see “Playing the Game

The Skills entry specifies a monster’s skill profi-
ciencies, if any. For example, a monster that is very
perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wis-
dom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A
skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability
modifier and its Proficiency Bonus. Other modifiers
Resistances and Vulnerabilities
might apply.

These entries list a monster’s Resistances and Vul-
nerabilities, if any. See “Playing the Game” for more
information.

Running a MonsteR
To ensure a monster acts in accordance with its
Challenge Rating, follow these rules during combat:

Special Abilities. If the monster has a special abil-
ity that deals a lot of damage but has a limited
number of uses, such as a recharging breath
weapon or a spell it can cast only once per day,
have it use that special ability as quickly and as
often as possible.

Multiattack. If the monster has Multiattack, have
it use Multiattack on any of its turns in which
it’s not using one of its more powerful abilities.
Bonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions. If
the monster has Bonus Actions, Reactions, or
Legendary Actions in its stat block, make sure it
uses them as often as it can.

Immunities

This entry lists the monster’s Immunities, if any. If
the monster has damage and condition Immunities,
the damage types are listed before the conditions.
Gear
See “Playing the Game” for details.

Monsters have proficiency with their equipment. If
a monster has equipment that can be given away or
retrieved, the items are listed in the Gear entry. The
monster’s stat block might include special flour-
ishes that happen when the monster uses an item,
and the stat block might ignore the rules in “Equip-
ment” for that item. When used by someone else, a
retrievable item uses its “Equipment” rules, ignor-
ing any special flourishes in the stat block.
  The Gear entry doesn’t necessarily list all of a
monster’s equipment. For example, a monster that
wears clothes is assumed to be dressed appropri-
ately, and those clothes aren’t in this entry.
  Equipment mentioned outside the Gear entry is
considered to be supernatural or highly specialized,
Ammunition and Ranged Attacks
and it is unusable when the monster is defeated.

A monster that requires ammunition to make
Equipping a Monster with Other Items
ranged attacks carries the necessary ammunition.

You may equip monsters with additional gear how-
ever you like, using the items in “Equipment” for
inspiration. You decide how much of a monster’s
equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain
and whether any of that equipment is still usable.
  Beware of giving a monster combat-oriented
magic items, since those might alter the monster’s
Challenge Rating. If you do give a monster a magic
item, the monster can have Attunement with magic
items as noted in “Equipment.” A monster with

252

System Reference Document 5.2a class tag after its creature type is considered a
Senses
member of that class for Attunement purposes.

The Senses entry specifies a monster’s Passive
Perception score, as well as any special senses the
monster possesses. Passive Perception and special
Languages
senses are described in “Rules Glossary

.”

This entry lists languages that the monster can use
to communicate. Sometimes a monster can under-
stand a language but can’t communicate with it,
which is noted in its entry. “None” indicates that a
Telepathy
creature doesn’t comprehend any language.

Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature
to communicate mentally with another creature
within a specified range. See “Rules Glossary”
for

more information.

A monster can take the actions in this section or
take one of the actions available to all creatures, as
Attack Notation
described in “Playing the Game.”

The entry for a monster’s attack identifies whether
the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then
provides the attack roll’s bonus, its reach or range,
and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one
target unless its entry says otherwise. For details
on different kinds of attacks, see “Playing the Game”
and “Spells.”
Hit:

 Any damage dealt or other effects that occur

Hit.

after the “

” notation.

Miss:

Hit or Miss.

 If an attack has an effect that occurs on a

miss, that information follows the “

” notation.
 If an attack has an effect that occurs

Hit or Miss:

regardless of whether it hits or misses its target,
Saving Throw Effect Notation
that information follows the “

” notation.

If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect identi-
fies the kind of save required and then provides the
save’s DC, a description of which creatures make
the save, and an explanation of what happens on a
failed or successful save.
  “Half damage only” on a successful save means
the target takes half as much damage (round down)
as targets that fail the save, while also ignoring all
other parts of the effect.

System Reference Document 5.2

Damage Notation

Reactions

If the monster has Reaction options, those are listed
in this section along with their triggers. See “Play-
Legendary Actions
ing the Game” for details on Reactions.

If the monster has Legendary Action options, those
are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is an
action that a monster can take immediately after
another creature’s turn. Only one of these actions
can be taken at a time and only after another crea-
ture’s turn ends. The monster can’t take a Legend-
ary Action if it has the Incapacitated condition or is
otherwise unable to take actions.
  The monster has a limited number of Legendary
Action uses, and that number is specified in the
stat block. The monster expends one use whenever
it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all ex-
Limited Usage
pended uses at the start of each of its turns.

Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the
number of times they can be used. Here are the
X/Day.
most common ways that usage is limited:

 This notation means the stat block part can

be used a certain number of times (represented
by X) and that a monster must finish a Long Rest
to regain expended uses. For example, a Reaction
that includes “1/Day” means the Reaction can be
taken once and that the monster must finish a
Long Rest to take it again.

Recharge X–Y.

 This notation means a monster

can use the stat block part once. At the start of
each of the monster’s turns, roll 1d6. If the roll
is within the number range given in the notation
(represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use
of that part, which also recharges when the mon-
ster finishes a Short or Long Rest. For example,
“Recharge 5–6” in an action means a monster can
take the action once. Then, at the start of each of
the monster’s turns, it regains the use of that ac-
tion if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6.

Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.

tion means the monster can use the stat block
part once and must then finish a Short or Long
Rest to use it again.

 This nota-

A stat block usually provides both a number and a
die expression for each instance of damage. For ex-
ample, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a
hit. You decide whether to use the number or the die
Multiattack
expression in parentheses; don’t use both.

Some creatures can make more than one attack
when they take the Attack action. Such creatures
have the Multiattack entry in the “Actions” section
of their stat block. This entry details the attacks a
creature can make, as well as any additional abili-
Spellcasting
ties it can use, as part of the Attack action.

If a monster can cast any spells, its stat block lists
the spells and provides the monster’s spellcasting
ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving
throw), and spell attack bonus (if any spells require
an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell of
level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible
level and can’t be cast at a higher level.
  A monster’s spell can have special rules or restric-
bility
tions. For example, a green hag can cast the

Invisi-

 spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction,

Spell Components.

which means the spell affects only the hag.

 The Spellcasting trait notes

whether the monster’s spellcasting ignores the
need for certain spell components. If any spell com-
ponents are required, describe the monster’s use of
Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to
characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that
requires Material components has them.

Casting Times of 1+ Minutes.

 If a spell has a cast-
ing time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spell-
casting action, the monster doesn’t cast the spell in
just one action unless the action’s description states
otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action
on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to
Bonus Action
cast the spell, as described in “Rules Glossary.”

If a monster has Bonus Action options, they are
listed in this section. See “Playing the Game” for de-
tails on Bonus Actions.

Traits
Amphibious. The aboleth can breathe air and water.

Eldritch Restoration. If destroyed, the aboleth gains
a new body in 5d10 days, reviving with all its Hit
Points in the Far Realm or another location chosen
by the GM.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair). If
the aboleth fails a saving throw, it can choose to suc-
ceed instead.

Mucus Cloud. While underwater, the aboleth is sur-
rounded by mucus. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 14,
each creature in a 5-foot Emanation originating from
the aboleth at the end of the aboleth’s turn. Failure: The
target is cursed. Until the curse ends, the target’s skin
becomes slimy, the target can breathe air and water,
and it can’t regain Hit Points unless it is underwater.
  While the cursed creature is outside a body of water,
the creature takes 6 (1d12) Acid damage at the end of
every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to its skin
before those minutes have passed.

Probing Telepathy. If a creature the aboleth can see
communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the abo-
leth learns the creature’s greatest desires.

Actions
Multiattack. The aboleth makes two Tentacle attacks
and uses either Consume Memories or Dominate Mind
if available.

Tentacle. Melee Attack Roll: +9, reach 15 ft. Hit: 12
(2d6 + 5) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large
or smaller creature, it has the Grappled condition (es-

one creature within 30 feet that is Charmed or Grap-
pled by the aboleth. Failure: 10 (3d6) Psychic damage.

255

Success: Half damage. Failure or Success: The aboleth
gains the target’s memories if the target is a Humanoid
and is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this action.

Dominate Mind (2/Day). Wisdom Saving Throw: DC
16, one creature the aboleth can see within 30 feet.
Failure: The target has the Charmed condition until
the aboleth dies or is on a different plane of existence
from the target. While Charmed, the target acts as an
ally to the aboleth and is under its control while within
60 feet of it. In addition, the aboleth and the target
can communicate telepathically with each other over
any distance.
  The target repeats the save whenever it takes damage
as well as after every 24 hours it spends at least 1 mile
away from the aboleth, ending the effect on itself on
a success.

Legendary Actions
Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after
another creature’s turn, the aboleth can expend a use to
take one of the following actions. The aboleth regains all
expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

Charmed or Grappled, it uses Consume Memories and
regains 5 (1d10) Hit Points.

Actions
Crush. Melee Attack Roll: +5, reach 5 ft. Hit: 6 (1d6
+ 3) Bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches
to the target. If the target is a Medium or smaller crea-
ture and the darkmantle had Advantage on the attack
roll, it covers the target, which has the Blinded condi-
tion and is suffocating while the darkmantle is attached
in this way.
  While attached to a target, the darkmantle can attack
only the target but has Advantage on its attack rolls. Its
Speed becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to its
Speed, and it moves with the target.
  A creature can take an action to try to detach the
darkmantle from itself, doing so with a successful DC
13 Strength (Athletics) check. On its turn, the darkman-
tle can detach itself by using 5 feet of movement.

Darkness Aura (1/Day). Magical Darkness fills a 15-foot
Emanation originating from the darkmantle. This effect
lasts while the darkmantle maintains Concentration
on it, up to 10 minutes. Darkvision can’t penetrate this
area, and no light can illuminate it.

Traits
Ooze Cube. The cube fills its entire space and is trans-
parent. Other creatures can enter that space, but a
creature that does so is subjected to the cube’s Engulf
and has Disadvantage on the saving throw.
  Creatures inside the cube have Total Cover, and the
cube can hold one Large creature or up to four Medium
or Small creatures inside itself at a time.
  As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the cube can
pull a creature or an object out of the cube by suc-
ceeding on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, and the
puller takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage.

Transparent. Even when the cube is in plain sight, a
creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check to notice the cube if the creature hasn’t wit-
nessed the cube move or otherwise act.

Actions
Pseudopod. Melee Attack Roll: +4, reach 5 ft. Hit: 12
(3d6 + 2) Acid damage.

Engulf. The cube moves up to its Speed without
provoking Opportunity Attacks. The cube can move
through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures if it has
room inside itself to contain them (see the Ooze Cube
trait). Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 12, each creature
whose space the cube enters for the first time during
this move. Failure: 10 (3d6) Acid damage, and the target
is engulfed. An engulfed target is suffocating, can’t cast
spells with a Verbal component, has the Restrained
condition, and takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the start
of each of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves,
the engulfed target moves with it. An engulfed target
can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC
12 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check,
the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied
space. Success: Half damage, and the target moves to
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cube. If there
is no unoccupied space, the target fails the save instead.

but it can’t affect or be affected by anything on the
other plane.

Horrific Visage. Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 13, each
creature in a 60-foot Cone that can see the ghost and
isn’t an Undead. Failure: 10 (2d6 + 3) Psychic damage,
and the target has the Frightened condition until the
start of the ghost’s next turn. Success: The target is im-
mune to this ghost’s Horrific Visage for 24 hours.

Possession (Recharge 6). Charisma Saving Throw: DC
13, one Humanoid the ghost can see within 5 feet. Fail-
ure: The target is possessed by the ghost; the ghost dis-
appears, and the target has the Incapacitated condition
and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls
the body, but the target retains awareness. The ghost
can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect,
except ones that specifically target Undead. The ghost’s
game statistics are the same, except it uses the pos-
sessed target’s Speed, as well as the target’s Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers.
  The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 Hit
Points or the ghost leaves as a Bonus Action. When the
possession ends, the ghost appears in an unoccupied
space within 5 feet of the target, and the target is im-
mune to this ghost’s Possession for 24 hours.
