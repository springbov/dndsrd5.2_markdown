Travel Pace

A group of characters can travel overland at a Nor-
mal, Fast, or Slow pace, as described in “Playing the
Game.” During any journey stage, the predominant
terrain determines the characters’ maximum travel
pace, as shown in the Maximum Pace column of the
Travel Terrain table. Certain factors can affect a
Good Roads
group’s travel pace.

The presence of a good road increases the group’s
maximum pace by one step (from Slow to Normal or
Slower Travelers
from Normal to Fast).

The group must move at a Slow pace if any group
Extended Travel
member’s Speed is reduced to half or less of normal.

Characters can push themselves to travel for more
than 8 hours per day, at the risk of tiring. At the end
of each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours,
each character must succeed on a Constitution sav-
ing throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 10

A character’s background represents what the char-
acter did prior to becoming an adventurer. Creating
a unique background or customizing an existing
one can reflect the particular theme of your cam-

a background to help a player craft the story they
have in mind for their character.

Magical Contagions

A curse is a magical burden that lasts for a specified
time or until it is ended by some means. A magical
contagion is an adverse effect of magical origin that
is contagious by definition.
  The following sections discuss curses and magical

contagions in detail.

A curse typically takes one of the forms detailed

gauging the potency of other curses. A curse that
lasts for 1 minute equates to a level 3 spell, while
one that lasts until dispelled equates to a level 9
spell.Cursed Creatures

Some monsters are associated with curses, whether
as part of their origins or due to their ability to
spread curses—werewolves being a prime example.

193

A curse might manifest during an adventure when
a creature’s violation of a taboo warrants supernat-
ural punishment, such as breaking a vow, defiling a
tomb, or murdering an innocent. Such a curse can
have any effects you design, or it might be a custom-
ized version of another type of curse discussed in
this section.
  A creature affected by such a curse should know
why they’re being punished and be able to learn
how to end their curse, likely by symbolically
righting the wrong they committed. How a spell
like
 affects a curse that’s part of your
adventure is up to you—the spell might merely sup-
press the effects of the curse for a time. Regardless,
narrative curses should feel like rare, potent magic

Remove Curse

Some locations are so suffused with evil that any-
one who lingers there is burdened with a curse.
Demonic Possession is one example of an environ-
mental curse.

Demonic Possession.

 Demonic Possession arises
from the chaos and evil of the Abyss and commonly
besets creatures that interact with demonic objects
or linger in desecrated locations, where demonic
spirits await victims.
  A creature that becomes the target of Demonic
Possession must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma sav-
ing throw or be possessed by a bodiless demonic
entity. Whenever the possessed creature rolls a 1
on a D20 Test, the demonic entity takes control of
the creature and determines the creature’s behav-
ior thereafter. At the end of each of the possessed
creature’s later turns, the creature makes a DC 15
Charisma saving throw, regaining control of itself
on a success.
  After finishing a Long Rest, a creature with De-
monic Possession makes a DC 15 Charisma saving
throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on the
creature. A
spell or any magic
that removes a curse also ends the effect on it.

Magical Contagions

Sewer Plague
Magical Contagion

Alchemists, potion brewers, and areas of wild magic
are credited with creating the first magical con-
tagions. An outbreak of such a contagion can form
the basis of an adventure as characters search for a
Rest and Recuperation
cure and try to stop the contagion’s spread.

If a creature infected with a magical contagion
spends 3 days recuperating—engaging in no
activities that would interrupt a Long Rest—the
creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
at the end of the recuperation period. On a suc-
cessful save, the creature has Advantage on saving
throws to fight off the magical contagion for the

damage and has the Incapacitated condition as
it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the

 At the end of each Long

three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and
the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year.

 Any Humanoid (other
than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot

 Magic such as a
 spell ends the contagion immedi-

ism Kit can use it to create one dose of nonmagical
ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the
eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the oint-
ment suppresses the contagion on that creature for
24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way
for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and
applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on
the creature.

Environmental Effects
Deep Water

Heavy Precipitation

Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet
deep) presents additional challenges because of the
water’s pressure and cold temperature. After each
hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that
lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a DC 10 Consti-
Extreme Cold
tution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level.

When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or
lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at
the end of each hour or gain 1 Exhaustion level.
Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Cold
Extreme Heat
damage automatically succeed on the save.

When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or
higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and
without access to drinkable water must succeed on
a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour
or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 5 for the first
hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.
Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have
Disadvantage on the save. Creatures that have Re-
sistance or Immunity to Fire damage automatically
Frigid Water
succeed on the save.

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a
number of minutes equal to its Constitution score
before suffering any ill effects. Each additional
minute spent in frigid water requires the creature
to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or
gain 1 Exhaustion level. Creatures with Resistance
or Immunity to Cold damage automatically suc-
ceed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally
adapted to living in ice-cold water.

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy
snowfall is Lightly Obscured, and creatures in the
area have Disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception)
High Altitude
checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.

Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above
sea level is taxing for most creatures because of the
reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such
a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts
as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long
that creature can travel (see “Travel Pace”).
  Creatures can become acclimated to a high alti-
tude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation.
Creatures can’t become acclimated to elevations
above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such
Slippery Ice
environments.

Slippery ice is Difficult Terrain. A creature that
moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn
or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10
Strong Wind
Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.

Strong wind imposes Disadvantage on ranged at-
tack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open
flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a
strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.
  A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm
that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
Thin Ice
checks.

Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds
per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight
on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice
in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall
through. Below the ice is frigid water (see “Frigid
Water” above).

System Reference Document 5.2Fear and Mental Stress

Mental Stress Effects

Due to the nature of their vocation, adventurers
tend to be less susceptible to fear and mental stress
than common folk. Whereas a farmer might flee in
terror from a bear or an apparition, adventurers are
made of sterner stuff. That said, certain creatures
and game effects can terrify or fray the mind of
even the most stalwart adventurer.
  If you plan to use any of these rules, discuss them
Fear Effects
with your players at the start of the campaign.

Whenever the characters encounter something that
is supernaturally frightful, use the Frightened con-
dition as the baseline effect. Fear effects typically
require a Wisdom saving throw, with a save DC
based on how terrifying the situation is. The Sample
Sample Fear DCs
Fear DCs table provides some examples.

Example

Save DC

When the characters open a sarcophagus, a
harmless yet terrifying apparition appears.

A character triggers a magical trap that
creates an illusory manifestation of that
character’s worst fears, visible only to that
character.

A portal to the Abyss opens, revealing a
nightmarish realm of torment and slaughter.

20

Typically, a Frightened creature repeats the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the ef-
fect on itself on a success.
  At your discretion, a Frightened creature might
be subject to other effects as long as the Frightened
condition lasts. Consider these examples:

•  The Frightened creature must take the Dash ac-

tion on each of its turns and uses its movement to
get farther away from the source of its fear.

•  Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have

•

Advantage.
  The Frightened creature can do only one of the
following on each of its turns: move, take an ac-
tion, or take a Bonus Action.

When a character is subjected to an effect that
causes intense mental stress, Psychic damage is the
best way to emulate that effect.
  The Sample Mental Stress Effects table provides a
few examples of such effects, with suggested saving
throw DCs and damage. Mental stress can usually
be resisted with a successful Wisdom save, but
sometimes an Intelligence or Charisma save is more
appropriate. On a successful save, a character might
take half as much damage instead of no damage, at

Poison

Sample Poisons

Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are
a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures.
Contact.
  Poisons come in the following four types:

 Contact poison can be smeared on an

object and remains potent until it is touched or
washed off. A creature that touches contact poi-
son with exposed skin suffers its effects.

Ingested.

 A creature must swallow an entire dose
of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose
can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may de-
cide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such
as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or
dealing only half as much damage on a failed save.
 Poisonous powders and gases take effect

Inhaled.

Injury.

when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing
the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its
effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately
afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective
against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal mem-
branes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
 Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus
Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or
similar object. The poison remains potent until
delivered through a wound or washed off. A crea-
ture that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from
an object coated with the poison is exposed to its
effects.

Purchasing Poison

In some settings, laws prohibit the possession and
use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous
apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters
with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poi-
son easily. Other characters might have to make ex-
tensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire
Harvesting Poison
the poison they seek.

A character can attempt to harvest poison from a
venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapaci-
tated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after
which the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence
(Nature) check using a Poisoner’s Kit. On a success-
ful check, the character harvests enough poison
for a single dose, and no additional poison can be
harvested from that creature. On a failed check,
the character is unable to extract any poison. If the
character fails the check by 5 or more, the character
is subjected to the creature’s poison.

197

Example poisons are detailed here in alphabetical
order. Each poison’s description includes the sug-
gested price for a single dose of the poison, its type
(contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury), and a descrip-

tion of the poison’s debilitating effects.
Ingested Poison

A creature subjected to Assassin’s Blood makes a
DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature takes 6 (1d12) Poison damage and has
the Poisoned condition for 24 hours. On a successful
Burnt Othur Fumes (500 GP)
save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
Inhaled Poison

A creature subjected to Burnt Othur Fumes must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or
take 10 (3d6) Poison damage, and it must repeat the
save at the start of each of its turns. On each succes-
sive failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) Poison
damage. After three successful saves, the poison
ends.Crawler Mucus (200 GP)
Contact Poison

A creature subjected to Crawler Mucus must suc-
ceed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have
the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. The creature
also has the Paralyzed condition while Poisoned in

failed save or half as much damage on a successful
one.Oil of Taggit (400 GP)

Traps should be used sparingly, lest they lose their
charm. A hidden pit can be a fun surprise, but too
many traps in an adventure can lead players to be-
come overly cautious, which slows down the game.
  The best traps are fleeting distractions that
skilled characters can overcome in a short amount
of time or deadly puzzles that require quick think-
ing and teamwork to overcome. Traps that are un-

parts after the trap’s name:

 A trap is designated as a nui-

sance or as deadly for characters of certain levels.
A nuisance trap is unlikely to seriously harm char-
acters of the indicated levels, whereas a deadly
trap can grievously damage characters of the indi-
cated levels.

Trigger.

 Traps are often set to go off when a crea-

ture enters an area or touches an object. Examples
of triggers include stepping on a pressure plate,
crossing a trip wire, turning a doorknob, or using
the wrong key in a lock.

Duration.

Some traps have durations expressed

in rounds, minutes, or hours. Others specify that
their effects last until the trap is destroyed or
dispelled. If a trap’s duration is instantaneous, its
effect is resolved instantly. If a trap resets after
activating, that fact is noted in this entry. A trap is
otherwise inert after activation.

Use caution when introducing a trap to characters
of a level lower than the trap’s level range. A trap
that is a nuisance at one level range could be deadly

ground and stretches between two weak supports
that topple when the trip wire is pulled.
  The first creature that crosses the trip wire
causes the supports to topple and the unstable sec-

stretches between two columns or trees.
  The first creature that crosses the trip wire
causes the Net to fall on it. The target must suc-

can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire
and the suspended Net on a successful check. Once
detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided
(no ability check required).

Destroy the Net.

 Reducing the Net to 0 Hit Points
frees any creature trapped in it (see “Adventuring
Gear” for the Net’s statistics).

Set the Trap.

 A creature that has Thieves’ Tools
and all the trap’s components (including a Net) can
try to set a falling net trap, doing so with a success-
ful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Each
attempt to set this trap takes 10 minutes.

At Higher Levels.

 You can scale the trap for higher

levels by increasing the weight of the Net, which
increases the save DC and the DC of the Strength
(Athletics) check as follows: DC 12 at levels 5–10, DC

When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure
plate for the first time on a turn or starts its turn
there, a nearby statue exhales a 15-foot Cone of
magical flame. The statue can look like anything,
such as a dragon or a wizard. Each creature in the
Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 11 (2d10) Fire damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Detect Magic

 A

 spell reveals
an aura of Evocation magic around the statue. As a
Search action, a creature within 5 feet of the statue
can examine it and make a DC 10 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check, detecting a tiny glyph on the statue on a
successful check. Once the glyph is found, a charac-
ter can take a Study action to examine it and make a
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, ascertaining that
the glyph means “fire” on a successful check. As an
action, a character can use a sharp tool to deface the
glyph, which disarms the trap.
  As a Search action, a creature can examine the
section of floor that forms the pressure plate and
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting
the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging

When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure

shoot from tubes embedded in the surrounding
walls. The holes that house these tubes are ob-
scured by dust and cobwebs or skillfully hidden
amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes.
  Each creature in the darts’ path must succeed on
a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by 1d3
darts, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage per dart.

 Until the stone stops rolling

When a creature moves onto a hidden pressure
plate, a 5-foot-radius orb of solid stone is released
from a secret compartment and begins to roll. The
stone and all creatures nearby roll Initiative; the
stone gets a +8 bonus on its Initiative roll.
  On its turn, the stone moves 60 feet in one direc-
tion, changing course if redirected by an obstacle.
The stone can move through creatures’ spaces,
and creatures can move through the stone’s space,
treating it as Difficult Terrain. Whenever the stone
enters a creature’s space for the first time on a turn
or a creature enters the stone’s space while the
stone is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) Blud-
geoning damage and have the Prone condition.
  The stone stops when it hits a wall or similar
barrier. It can’t go around corners, but creative
dungeon builders incorporate curving turns into
nearby passages that allow the stone to keep

locations or defensive positions force characters

 When different types

 An encounter of low difficulty is
likely to have one or two scary moments for the
players, but their characters should emerge vic-

might need to use healing resources, however.
As a rough guideline, a single monster generally

four characters whose level equals the monster’s

 Absent healing and other re-

go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters

Step 3: Spend Your Budget

Every creature has an XP value in its stat block.
When you add a creature to your combat encounter,
deduct its XP from your XP budget to determine
how many XP you have left to spend. Spend as much
of your XP budget as you can without going over. It’s
OK if you have a few unspent XP left over. Examples

keep the following in mind.

The more creatures in an encounter, the higher

more damage to the characters than you expect. If
your encounter includes more than two creatures

A player’s absence might warrant removing crea-
tures from an encounter to keep it at the intended
difficulty. Also, die rolls and other factors can result
in an encounter being easier or harder than in-
tended. You can adjust an encounter on the fly, such
as by having creatures flee (making the encounter
easier) or adding reinforcements (making the en-
counter harder).
