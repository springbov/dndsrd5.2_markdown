# Magic Items

Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled
monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such
items grant capabilities a character could rarely
have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s

capabilities in wondrous ways.

Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic
Item Categories table lists the nine categories and
provides examples. Rules for the categories appear

Armor

An item in the Armor category is typically a magical
version of armor from “Equipment.” Unless an ar-
mor’s description notes otherwise, the armor must
be worn for its magic to function.
  Some suits of magic armor specify the type of ar-
mor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If
no type is specified, choose the type or determine it
Potions
randomly.

An item in the Potion category might be a magical
brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be
applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion
consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.

Using a Potion.

 Potions are consumable items.
Drinking a potion or administering it to another
creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil
might take longer as specified in its description.
Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it
is used up.

Mixing Potions.

 A character might drink one po-
tion while still under the effects of another or pour
several potions into a single container. The strange
ingredients used in creating potions can result in
unpredictable interactions.

  When a character mixes two potions together, roll
on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are
combined, roll again for each subsequent potion,
combining the results. Unless the effects are imme-
diately obvious, reveal them only when they become
Potion Miscibility
evident.

1d100 Result

01

Both potions lose their effects, and the
mixture creates a magical explosion in a
5-foot-radius Sphere centered on itself.
Each creature in that area takes 4d10 Force
damage.

02–08 Both potions lose their effects, and the mix-

ture becomes an ingested poison of your
choice (see “Poison” in “Gameplay Toolbox”).

09–15 Both potions lose their effects.

16–25 One potion loses its effect.

26–35 Both potions work, but with their numerical
effects and durations halved. If a potion has
no numerical effect and no duration, it instead
loses its effect.

36–90 Both potions work normally.

91–99 Both potions work, but the numerical effects
and duration of one potion are doubled. If nei-
ther potion has anything to double in this way,
they work normally.

00

Only one potion works, but its effects are
permanent. Choose the simplest effect to
make permanent or the one that seems the
most fun. For example, a Potion of Healing
might increase the drinker’s Hit Point maxi-
mum by 2d4 + 2, or a Potion of Invisibility might
give the drinker the Invisible condition indefi-
nitely. At your discretion, a Dispel Magic spell
or similar magic might end this lasting effect.

Rings

For its magic to function, an item in the Ring cate-
gory must be worn on a finger or a similar digit un-
Rods
less its description notes otherwise.

An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually
made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs
2 to 5 pounds.
  Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can
be used as an Arcane Focus.

204

System Reference Document 5.2

Scrolls

An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or
parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods
and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade,
leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is
the

, a spell stored in written form.

 Scrolls are consumable items. Un-

leashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to
read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked,
the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it
crumbles into dust.
  Any creature that can understand a written lan-
guage can read a scroll and attempt to activate it
Staffs
unless its description notes otherwise.

Items in the Staff category vary widely in appear-
ance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout
and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some
are made of wood, and others are composed of pol-
ished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and
7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.
  Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can
be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane
Focus.Wands

An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15
inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It
is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other
material.
  Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand
Weapons
can be used as an Arcane Focus.

A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a
weapon from “Equipment.” Some magic weapons
specify the type of weapon they are in their de-
scriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no
weapon type is specified, you may choose the type
or determine it randomly.

Ammunition.

 If a magic weapon has the Ammu-

nition property, ammunition fired from it is consid-
ered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares
Wondrous Items
whether a weapon is magical or not.

Wondrous Items include wearable items such
as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and
circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical
instruments, and more also fall into this category.

205

Magic iteM Rules
Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic
items appear in “Equipment.” Additional rules are
presented below.
  Attunement Prerequisites. If a magic item has
a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of
that class to attune to the item. If a creature must be
a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qual-
ifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or
features, not by using a magic item or the like.
  Items Made for Specific Creatures. Magic
items that are meant to be worn tend to magically
adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can
decide that a magic item doesn’t adjust its size to fit
any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might
make items usable only by folk who are sized and
shaped like dwarves.
  Unusual Anatomy. Use your discretion to decide
whether a creature can wear an item not made for
its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might work,
but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t
wear magic boots.
  Paired Items. You can allow exceptions to the
rule that paired items must both be worn. For ex-
ample, a character with only one arm might be able
to use a single Glove of Missile Snaring so long as the
matching glove is on their person.

Magic Item Rarity

Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a
rough measure of an item’s power relative to other
magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic
Potion of Healing
Item Rarities and Values table.
  Common magic items, such as a
Orb
are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the
Magic Item Values by Rarity

, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.

Dragon
,

Common magic items can often be bought in a
town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are
usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items
might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a
city on another plane of existence. If you allow char-
acters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign,
rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold
Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities
and Values table, though a seller might ask for a ser-
vice rather than coin as payment.
  If a magic item incorporates an item that has a
purchase cost in “Equipment” (such as a weapon or
a suit of armor), add that item’s cost to the magic
 (Plate Armor)
item’s value. For example,

+1 Armor

has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare
magic item’s value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate

The value of a Spell Scroll is double what it costs to scribe the scroll
(as specified in the “Scribing Spell Scrolls” section of “Equipment”).

Activating a Magic Item

It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic
item. The item’s user might also need to do some-
thing special. The description of each item category
or individual item details how an item is activated.
Certain items use the following rules for their
Command Word
activation.

A command word is a word or short phrase that
must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spo-
ken command words must be audible and fail to
work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in
Consumable Items

the area of the

Silence

Potion of Healing

Some items are consumed—used up, in other
words—when they are activated. A
must be swallowed, for example, while the writing
vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a
Spells Cast from Items
consumable item loses its magic.

Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible
spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the us-
er’s spell slots, and requires no components unless
the item’s description notes otherwise. The spell
uses its normal casting time, range, and duration,
and the user of the item must concentrate if the
spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as
Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the
spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain items
make exceptions to these rules, changing the cast-
ing time, duration, or other parts of a spell.
  A magic item may require the user to use their
own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from
the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting
ability, the user chooses which one to use with the
item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability,

206

their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item,
Charges
and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies.

Identify

Some magic items have charges that must be ex-
pended to activate their properties. The number
of charges an item has remaining is revealed when
the
 spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to
an item knows how many charges the item has and
“The Next Dawn”
how many it regains.

Magic items often have charges or properties that
recharge at the next dawn or some other specified
time. If such an item is on a world or plane of exis-
tence where the specified event doesn’t occur, the
Cursed Items
GM determines when the item recharges.

Identify

A magic item’s description specifies whether it
bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, in-
 spell, fail to reveal such a curse.
cluding the
  Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended volun-

tarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a

 spell.

A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical
item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Po-
tions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage.
  An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special
way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learn-
ing how to destroy an Artifact usually requires

 For each day of crafting, you must
work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days,
those days needn’t be consecutive.

Assistants.

 Characters can combine their efforts

to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed
to create an item by the number of characters work-
ing on it. Normally, only one other character can
assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.
 The cost in the table represents

the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The
GM determines whether appropriate raw materials
are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance
that the materials are available, and in any other
settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials
aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before
checking on the availability again.
  If a magic item incorporates an item that has a

you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item

Sentient Magic Items

Some magic items have sentience and personality.
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the
spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to
the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be
a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in
the side.
  Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds
of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items
such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.
  The GM controls sentient magic items and their
activated properties. A bearer who maintains a
good relationship with the item can access those
properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict
Sentient Magic Item Traits
can ensue (see “Conflict” below).

When you make a sentient magic item, you create
the item’s persona much as you would create an
Abilities
NPC, with these exceptions.

A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores. Choose the item’s abilities, or de-
termine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each
Alignment
one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.

A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator
or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise,
pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item’s
Communication
Alignment table.

A sentient item communicates by sharing its emo-
tions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or
speaking aloud. You can choose how it communi-
cates or roll on the Sentient Item’s Communication

table.

A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to
a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on

Special Purpose

You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues,
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the

wielder and the item (see “Conflict” below). You can

If its bearer refuses to comply with the item’s de-

•  Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it.
•  Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
•  Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon
the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC
12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed
save, the bearer has the Charmed condition for
1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the
bearer must try to follow the item’s commands.
If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save,
ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the
attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item
can’t use this power again until the next dawn.

You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class against ranged
attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus
is in addition to the Shield’s normal bonus to AC.
  Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll
against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a
Bag of Beans
Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
Wondrous Item, Rare

This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when
found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of
how many beans it contains and becomes a non-
magical item when it no longer contains any beans.
  If you dump one or more beans out of the bag,
they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on
them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the ex-
plosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including
you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking
5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one.
  If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt
or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it
produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground
where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect
from the following table or determine it randomly.

Effect

1d100

01

5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a
toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the
eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and
have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On
an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary
Hit Points for 1 hour.

1d100

Effect

11–20 A Treant sprouts. Roll any die. On an odd
roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even
roll, the treant is Chaotic Good.

21–30 An animate but immobile stone statue in

your likeness rises and makes verbal threats
against you. If you leave it and others come
near, it describes you as the most heinous
of villains and directs the newcomers to find
and attack you. If you are on the same plane
of existence as the statue, it knows where
you are. The statue becomes inanimate after
24 hours.

31–40 A campfire with green flames springs

forth and burns for 24 hours or until it is
extinguished.

Three Shrieker Fungi sprout.

1d4 + 4 bright-pink toads crawl forth. When-
ever a toad is touched, it transforms into a
Large or smaller monster of the GM’s choice
that acts in accordance with its alignment
and nature. The monster remains for 1 min-
ute, then disappears in a puff of bright-pink
smoke.

61–70 A hungry Bulette burrows up and attacks.

71–80 A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8

of which act as randomly determined po-
tions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked
fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.

81–90 A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs
springs up. Any creature that eats an egg
makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw.
On a successful save, a creature permanently
increases its lowest ability score by 1, ran-
domly choosing among equally low scores.
On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6
Force damage from an internal explosion.

91–95 A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts
upward. Inside is a burial chamber containing
a Mummy, a Mummy Lord, or some other
Undead of the GM’s choice. Its sarcophagus
contains treasure of the GM’s choice.

96–00 A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a

height of the GM’s choice. The top leads
where the GM chooses, such as to a great
view, a cloud giant’s castle, or another plane
of existence.

02–10 A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer,

mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s
choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d4 minutes.

Bag of Devouring
Wondrous Item, Very Rare

Bag of Holding

Bag of Tricks
Wondrous Item, Uncommon

but is a feeding

This bag resembles a
orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature.
Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.
  The extradimensional creature attached to the
bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag.
Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the
bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a liv-
ing creature is placed in the bag, as happens when
someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent
chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A
creature inside the bag can take an action to try to
escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength
(Athletics) check. Another creature can take an ac-
tion to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, do-
ing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics)
check, provided the puller isn’t pulled inside the bag
first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag
is devoured, its body destroyed.
  Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which
can hold a cubic foot of such material. However,
once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside
it and spits them out into another plane of existence.
The GM determines the time and plane.
  If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and
anything contained within it is transported to a
Bag of Holding
random location on the Astral Plane.
Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This bag has an interior space considerably larger
than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square
and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up
to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic
feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its
contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires
a Utilize action.
  If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is de-
stroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral
Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents
spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right
before it can be used again. The bag holds enough
air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the num-
ber of breathing creatures inside.

and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate orig-
inates where the one item was placed inside the
other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere
centered on the gate is sucked through it to a ran-
dom location on the Astral Plane. The gate then
closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened.

212

This bag made from gray, rust, or tan cloth appears
empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals
the presence of a small, fuzzy object.
  You can take a Magic action to pull the fuzzy ob-
ject from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When
the object lands, it transforms into a creature you
determine by rolling on the table that corresponds
to the bag’s color. See “Monsters” for the creature’s
stat block. The creature vanishes at the next dawn
or when it is reduced to 0 Hit Points.
  The creature is Friendly to you and your allies,
and it acts immediately after you on your Initiative
count. You can take a Bonus Action to command
how the creature moves and what action it takes on
its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the ab-
sence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion
appropriate to its nature.
  Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from
the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next

the weapon is in your possession, you must succeed

  While berserk, you regard the creature nearest

are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action
to draw a card at random from the deck and throw
it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself.
An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on
the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown
card and remains until dispelled. The illusory crea-
ture created by the card looks and behaves like a
real creature of its kind, except that it can do no
harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory
creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action
to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.
  Any physical interaction with the illusory crea-
ture reveals it to be false, because objects pass
through it. A creature that takes a Study action to
visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as
an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (In-
Dispel
vestigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card
is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a

 spell or a similar effect). When the illusion
ends, the image on its card disappears, and that

of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the
weapon’s bonus to your Armor Class. For example,
you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and

 Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t

you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against de-

special abilities.
Wondrous Item, Rare

You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles
on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition.
The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to
Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound
by them from using any method of extradimen-
sional movement, including teleportation or travel
to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent
the creature from passing through an interdimen-
sional portal.
  You and any creature you designate when you
use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove
them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can
make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a suc-
cessful check, the creature breaks free and destroys

Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in
diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in
diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
  While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic
action to peer into the orb’s depths. You must then
make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a success-
ful save, you control the orb for as long as you re-
main attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes
the Charmed condition on you for as long as you
remain attuned to it.

218

Suggestion

  While you are Charmed by the orb, you can’t
voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb
casts
 on you at will (save DC 18), urging
you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The
dragon essence within the orb might want many
things: the annihilation of a particular society or or-
ganization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffer-
ing in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat,
or something else the GM decides.

Spells.

 The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3

miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled
to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most
direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are un-
affected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to
the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling
them against their will. Once you have used this

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough
of it for one use. When you take a Utilize action to
throw the dust into the air, you and each creature
and object within a 10-foot Emanation originating
from you have the Invisible condition for 2d4 min-

the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect.

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust.
As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the
dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube of
water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats
or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The
pellet’s weight is negligible. A creature can take
a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard
surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the
water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pel-
let and ends its magic.

elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close
to the broken gem as possible, understands your
languages, obeys your commands, and takes its
turn immediately after you on your Initiative count.
The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies,

  Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow
out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot Emanation

Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies

This object looks like a feather. Different types of
feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use
effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or deter-
mines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens
table. The type of token determines its rarity.

Anchor (Uncommon).

 You can take a Magic action

to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next
24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means.
Touching the token to the vessel again ends the ef-

up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum
speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144
miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of
flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird
disappears after flying its maximum distance for a
day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the
bird as a Magic action.

System Reference Document 5.2

Fan (Uncommon).

 If you are on a boat or ship,

you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to
10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant
flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and cre-
ates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one
ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8
hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.

Swan Boat (Rare).

 You can take a Magic action to

touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet
in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-
long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its
place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across
water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take
a Magic action while on the boat to command it to
move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains
for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss
the boat as a Magic action.

Tree (Uncommon).

 You must be outdoors to use
this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it
to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token
disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree
springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and
has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the
top spread out in a 20-foot radius.

Whip (Rare).

 You can take a Magic action to

throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself.
The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its
place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a
melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet
of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the
target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.
  As a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to
fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a
creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip dis-
appears after 1 hour, when you take a Magic action
to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapaci-

reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine
early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if
you take a Magic action while touching the creature
to make it revert to figurine form. When the crea-

This backpack has a central pouch and two side
pouches, each of which is an extradimensional

of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet.
The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of ma-
terial, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The
haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its

you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the
item is always magically on top.
  If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or
torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the
haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever,
although an Artifact always turns up again some-

Horseshoes of a Zephyr
Wondrous Item, Very Rare

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic
action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the
hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the
horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a
horseshoe also takes a Magic action.
  While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a
horse or similar creature, they allow the creature
to move normally while floating 4 inches above a
surface. This effect means the creature can cross
or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such
as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and
ignores Difficult Terrain. In addition, the creature
can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining

a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a
square adamantine tower. Repeating the command

which works only if the tower is empty. Each crea-
ture in the area where the tower appears is pushed
to an unoccupied space outside but next to the
tower. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or
carried are also pushed clear of the tower.
  The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high,
with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop
it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a lad-

Wondrous Item, Rare

Javelin of Lightning
Weapon (Javelin), Uncommon

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diame-
ter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action
to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere
moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of
metal bands.
  Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus
equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Profi-
ciency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained
condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a
command that releases it. Doing so or missing with
the attack causes the bands to contract and become
a sphere once more.
  A creature that can touch the bands, including the
one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20
Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands.
On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the
Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any
further attempts made by that creature automati-
cally fail until 24 hours have elapsed.
  Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again
Iron Flask

Wondrous Item, Legendary

While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you
can take a Magic action to target a creature that
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask
is empty and the target is native to a plane of exis-
tence other than the one you’re on, the target must
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be
trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped
by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save.
Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until
released. The flask can hold only one creature at a
time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t age and
doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink.
  You can take a Magic action to remove the flask’s
stopper and release the creature in the flask. The
creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour,
understanding those commands even if it doesn’t
know the language in which the commands are
given. If you issue no commands or give the crea-

 When you throw this weapon at
a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can
forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn
the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms
a 5-foot-wide Line between you and the target. The
target and each other creature in the Line (exclud-

Marvelous Pigments
but regains it in a century.
Wondrous Item, Very Rare

This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment
and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total).
  Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment,
you can paint any number of three-dimensional
objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors,
trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided
these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube.
The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the num-
ber of elements you create), during which time you
must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentra-
tion. If your Concentration is broken or you leave
the Cube before the work is done, all the painted
elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.

System Reference Document 5.2
  When the work is done, all the painted objects
and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a
door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be
opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates
a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within
the 20-foot Cube.
  No object created by a pot of pigment can have a
value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all
objects created by a pot of pigment can’t exceed 500
GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a
large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close in-
spection reveals they’re made from paste, cookies,
or some other worthless material.

Wondrous Item, Very Rare

When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed
indirectly, its surface shows faint images of crea-
tures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC
11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage,
and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shat-
ters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.
  If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and
you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic
action and use a command word to activate it. It
remains activated until you take a Magic action and
repeat the command word to deactivate it.
  Any creature other than you that sees its reflec-
tion in the activated mirror while within 30 feet
of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma
saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it
is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve

  An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse
filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10
feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t
age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A
creature trapped within a cell can escape using
magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the

all creatures it contains are freed and appear in un-
occupied spaces near it.
  While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a
Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or
call out a particular cell by number. The creature
named or contained in the named cell appears as an
image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature
can then communicate.
  In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and
use a second command word to free one creature
trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears,
along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space
nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

Wondrous Item, Legendary

Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains
a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most
(75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but
some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column
of the Mysterious Deck table when randomly deter-
mining cards drawn from the deck.
  Before you draw a card, you must declare how
many cards you intend to draw and then draw them
randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this num-
ber have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a
card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must
draw each card no more than 1 hour after the pre-
vious draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number,
the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on
their own and take effect all at once.
  Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the
card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the
deck, making it possible to draw the same card
twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, re-
roll on the table if that card comes up again.)

When you attack a creature that has fewer than

Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires

When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in
Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter
or sign the following command words: “Swift death
to you who have wronged me.” The target of your
attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or
until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such
sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy
dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.
  When you make a ranged attack roll with this
weapon against your sworn enemy, you have Ad-
vantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no
benefit from Half Cover or Three-Quarters Cover,
and you suffer no Disadvantage due to long range.

Called swarms move toward the music by the short-

otherwise.
  Whenever a
other creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you
while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful
save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and
can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24
hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the
pipes’ music and becomes Friendly to you and your
allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes
each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm
obeys your commands. If you issue no commands
to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise
takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn
more than 30 feet away from you, your control over
that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it nor-
mally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ mu-
sic for the next 24 hours.

Ring, Rare (Requires Attunement)

up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found,
it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by
the GM.
  Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 5
into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast.
The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the
ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the spell is ex-
pended without effect. The level of the slot used to
cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

  While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell

Rod of Absorption
Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to
absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn’t
create an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect
is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell
itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same
level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell
dissipates with no effect, and any resources used
to cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store
up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its ex-
istence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy,
it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell
that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that
spell.
  When you become attuned to the rod, you know
how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed
over the course of its existence and how many levels
of spell energy it currently has stored.
  If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can
convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast
spells you have prepared or know. You can create
spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your
own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use
the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise
cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3
levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.

and Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. While in
that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1
bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can
sense the location of any Invisible creature that is
also in the Bright Light.
  The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends
after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic
action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used,
this property can’t be used again until the next

erties as well, detailed below.

 When you hit a creature with a melee

attack using the rod, you can force the target to
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic dam-
age, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to
half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property
can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Paralyze.

 When you hit a creature with a melee

attack using the rod, you can force the target to
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1

each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
Once used, this property can’t be used again until

 While holding the rod, you can take a
Magic action to force each creature you can see
within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom

to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this
way. Once used, this property can’t be used again
Rod of Security

Rod, Very Rare

While holding this rod, you can take a Magic action
to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you
and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see
to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane
takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern,
an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic car-
nival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless
of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water
and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane’s
environment can’t harm its occupants. Everything
else that can be interacted with there can exist
only there. For example, a flower picked from a
garden there disappears if it is taken outside the
demiplane.
  For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor
regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die.
Also, creatures don’t age while there, although time
passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to
200 days divided by the number of creatures pres-
ent (round down).
  When the time runs out or you take a Magic action
to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the loca-
tion they occupied when you activated the rod or an
unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used,
this property can’t be used again until 10 days have
Rope of Climbing

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This 60-foot length of rope can hold up to 3,000
pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can
take a Magic action to command the other end of the
rope to animate and move toward a destination you
choose, up to the rope’s length away from you. That
end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first com-
mand it and 10 feet at the start of each of your sub-
sequent turns until reaching its destination or until
you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten
itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to
knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.
  If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at
1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the
rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advan-
tage on ability checks made to climb using the rope.
  The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poi-
son and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every

Wondrous Item, Rare

This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of
the rope, you can take a Magic action to command
the other end to dart forward and entangle one
creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The
target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw or have the Restrained condition. You can re-
lease the target by letting go of your end of the rope
(causing the rope to coil up in the target’s space)
or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command
(causing the rope to coil up in your hand).
  A target Restrained by the rope can take an action
to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check,
the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If
you’re still holding onto the rope when a target es-
capes from it, you can take a Reaction to command
the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope
coils up in the target’s space.
  The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poi-
son and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every

  On your turn, you can mentally command the
snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of
you and you don’t have the Incapacitated condition.
You decide what action the snake takes and where it
moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general
command, such as to attack your enemies or guard
a location. Absent commands from you, the snake
defends itself.
  As a Bonus Action, you can command the snake
to revert to staff form in its current space, and you
can’t use the staff’s property again for 1 hour. If the
snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts
to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is de-
stroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before
losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.

1d100 Effect

01–20 You cast a spell originating from the chosen
point. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a
1–2, Darkness; on a 3–4, Faerie Fire; on a 5–6,
Fireball; on a 7–8, Slow; on a 9–10, Stinking
Cloud.

21–25 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin.

Instead, you have the Stunned condition until
the start of your next turn, believing some-
thing awesome just happened.

26–30 You cast Gust of Wind. The Line created by the
spell extends from you to the chosen point of
origin.

31–35 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin.
Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage.

36–40 Heavy rain falls for 1 minute in a 120-foot-

high, 60-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the
chosen point of origin. During that time, the
area of effect is Lightly Obscured.

41–45 A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a

60-foot-high, 30-foot-radius Cylinder centered
on the chosen point of origin. The butterflies
remain for 10 minutes, during which time the
area of effect is Heavily Obscured.

46–50 You cast Lightning Bolt. The Line created by the
spell extends from you to the chosen point of
origin.

51–55 The creature closest to the chosen point of

origin is enlarged as if you had cast Enlarge/
Reduce on it. If the target isn’t you and can’t be
affected by that spell, you become the target
instead.

1d100 Effect

56–60 A magically formed creature appears in an

unoccupied space as close to the chosen point
of origin as possible. The creature isn’t under
your control, acts as it normally would, and
disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0
Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which crea-
ture appears. On a 1, a Rhinoceros appears;
on a 2, an Elephant appears; and on a 3–4, a
Rat appears.

61–64 Grass covers a 60-foot-radius circle of ground,

with the center of that circle as close to the
chosen point of origin as possible. Grass that’s
already there grows to ten times its normal
size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.

65–68 An object of the GM’s choice disappears into

the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither
worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the cho-
sen point of origin, and no larger than 10 feet
in any dimension. If there are no such objects
in range, nothing happens.

69–72 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin.

Instead, you shrink as if you had cast Enlarge/
Reduce on yourself and remain in that state for
1 minute.

73–77 Leaves grow from the creature nearest to the
chosen point of origin. Unless they are picked
off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24
hours.

78–82 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin.

Instead, a burst of colorful, shimmering light
extends from you in a 30-foot Emanation.
Each creature in the area must succeed on a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the
Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature re-
peats the save at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.

83–87 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin.
Instead, you cast Invisibility on yourself.

88–92 Nothing happens at the chosen point of ori-

gin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each
worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand’s tip in a
Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the
chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Blud-
geoning damage, and the total damage of the
gems is divided equally among all creatures in
the Line.

98–00 The creature closest to the chosen point of

origin makes a DC 15 Constitution saving

stone. While Restrained in this way, the crea-
ture repeats the save at the end of its next
turn. On a successful save, the effect ends.
On a failed save, the creature has the Petrified
condition instead of the Restrained condition.
The petrification lasts until the creature is
freed by the Greater Restoration spell or similar
magic.
