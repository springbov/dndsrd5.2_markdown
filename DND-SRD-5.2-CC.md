# Playing the Game

## Rhythm of Play

The three main pillars of D&D play are social interaction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one you’re experiencing, the game unfolds according to this basic pattern:

1. **The Game Master Describes a Scene.**  The GM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, and so on).

2. **The Players Describe What Their Characters Do.** Typically, the characters stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another environment. Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the GM ensures that every character has a chance to act and decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the characters take turns.

3. **The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers’ Actions.** Sometimes resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to open a door, the GM might say the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the GM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the game back to step 1.

This pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the  adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations—particularly combat—the action is more structured, and everyone takes turns.

> **Exceptions Supersede General Rules**
> 
> General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That’s a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn’t explicitly say otherwise.
>
> The game also includes elements—class features, feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.

## The Six Abilities

All creatures — characters and monsters—have six abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table.

Table: Ability Descriptions

| Ability      | Score Measures …                    |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Strength     | Physical might                      |
| Dexterity    | Agility, reflexes, and balance      |
| Constitution | Health and stamina                  |
| Intelligence | Reasoning and memory                |
| Wisdom       | Perceptiveness and mental fortitude |
| Charisma     | Confidence, poise, and charm        |

### Ability Scores

Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some
monsters have a score as high as 30. The score
represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability
Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.

Table: Ability Scores

| Score | Meaning                                      | 
|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1     | This is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens. |
| 2–9   | This represents a weak capability.           |
| 10–11 | This represents the human average.           |
| 12–19 | This represents a strong capability.         |
| 20    | This is the highest an adventurer’s score can go unless a feature says otherwise. |
| 21–29 | This represents an extraordinary capability. |
| 30    | This is the highest a score can go.          |

### Ability Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a D20 Test with that ability (explained in “D20 Tests”). An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.

> **Round Down**
> Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make an exception and tell you to round up.

Table: Ability Modifiers

| Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|
| 1     | −5       |
| 2–3   | −4       |
| 4–5   | −3       |
| 6–7   | −2       |
| 8–9   | −1       |
| 10–11 | +0       |
| 12–13 | +1       |
| 14–15 | +2       |
| 16–17 | +3       |
| 18–19 | +4       |
| 20–21 | +5       |
| 22–23 | +6       |
| 24–25 | +7       |
| 26–27 | +8       |
| 28–29 | +9       |
| 30    | +10      |

## D20 Tests

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game uses a d20 roll to determine success or failure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. They follow these steps:

1. **Roll 1d20.** You always want to roll high. If the roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described later in “Playing the Game”), you roll two d20s, but you use the number from only one of them—the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower one if you have Disadvantage.

2. **Add Modifiers.** Add these modifiers to the number rolled on the d20:
  * **The Relevant Ability Modifier.** “Playing the Game” and “Rules Glossary” explain which ability modifiers to use for various D20 Tests.
  * **Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant.** Each creature has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added when making a D20 Test that uses something, such as a skill, in which the creature has proficiency. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game.”
  * **Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties.** A class feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus or penalty to the die roll.

3. **Compare the Total to a Target Number.** If the total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or exceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. The Game Master determines target numbers and tells players whether their rolls are successful. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC), which appears on a character sheet or in a stat block (see “Rules Glossary”).

### Ability Checks

An ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the rules often call for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result.

#### Ability Modifier

An ability check is named for the ability modifier it uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so on. Different ability checks are called for in different situations, depending on which ability is most relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for examples of each check’s use.

Table: Ability Check Examples

| Ability      | Make a Check To …                                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strength     | Lift, push, pull, or break something                       |
| Dexterity    | Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly                           |
| Constitution | Push your body beyond normal limits                        |
| Intelligence | Reason or remember                                         |
| Wisdom       | Notice things in the environment or in creatures’ behavior |
| Charisma     | Influence, entertain, or deceive                           |

#### Proficiency Bonus

Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check when the GM determines that a skill or tool proficiency is relevant to the check and you have that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for more information about skill and tool proficiencies.

#### Difficulty Class

The Difficulty Class of an ability check represents the task’s difficulty. The more difficult the task, the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain checks, but the GM ultimately sets them. The Typical Difficulty Classes table presents a range of possible DCs for ability checks.

Table: Typical Difficulty Classes

| Task Difficulty   | DC |
|-------------------|----|
| Very easy         | 5  |
| Easy              | 10 |
| Medium            | 15 |
| Hard              | 20 |
| Very hard         | 25 | 
| Nearly impossible | 30 |

### Saving Throws

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying to invade your mind. You don’t normally choose to make a save; you must make one because your character or a monster (if you’re the GM) is at risk. A save’s result is detailed in the effect that caused it.

If you don’t want to resist the effect, you can choose to fail the save without rolling.

#### Ability Modifier

Saving throws are named for the ability modifiers they use: a Constitution saving throw, a Wisdom saving throw, and so on. Different saving throws are used to resist different kinds of effects, as shown on the Saving Throw Examples table.

Table: Saving Throw Examples

| Ability      | Make a Save To …               |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Strength     | Physically resist direct force |
| Dexterity    | Dodge out of harm’s way        |
| Constitution | Endure a toxic hazard          |
| Intelligence | Recognize an illusion as fake  |
| Wisdom       | Resist a mental assault        |
| Charisma     | Assert your identity           |

#### Proficiency Bonus

You add your Proficiency Bonus to your saving throw if you have proficiency in that kind of save. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game.”

#### Difficulty Class

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it or by the GM. For example, if a spell forces you to make a save, the DC is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and Proficiency Bonus. Monster abilities that call for saves specify the DC.

### Attack Rolls

An attack roll determines whether an attack hits a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class. Attack rolls usually occur in battle, described in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game,” but the GM might also ask for an attack roll in other situations, such as an archery competition.

#### Ability Modifier

The Attack Roll Abilities table shows which ability modifier to use for different types of attack rolls.

Table: Attack Roll Abilities

| Ability      | Attack Type                                                                                                       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strength     | Melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike (see “Rules Glossary”)                                            |
| Dexterity    | Ranged attack with a weapon                                                                                       |
| Varies       | Spell attack (the ability used is determined by the spellcaster’s spellcasting feature, as explained in “Spells”) |

Some features let you use different ability modifiers from those listed. For example, the Finesse property (see “Equipment”) lets you use Strength or Dexterity with a weapon that has that property.

#### Proficiency Bonus

You add your Proficiency Bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon you have proficiency with, as well as when you attack with a spell. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for more information about weapon proficiencies.

#### Armor Class

A creature’s Armor Class represents how well the creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC of a character is determined at character creation (see “Character Creation”), whereas the AC of a monster appears in its stat block.

**Calculating AC.** All creatures start with the same base AC calculation:
 Base AC = 10 + the creature’s Dexterity modifier

A creature’s AC can then be modified by armor, magic items, spells, and more.

**Only One Base AC.** Some spells and class features give characters a different way to calculate their AC. A character with multiple features that give different ways to calculate AC must choose which one to use; only one base calculation can be in effect for a creature.

#### Rolling 20 or 1

If you roll a 20 on the d20 (called a “natural 20”) for an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a Critical Hit (see “Combat” later in “Playing the Game”).

If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”) for an attack roll, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.

### Advantage/Disadvantage

Sometimes a D20 Test is modified by Advantage or Disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvantage reflects negative circumstances.

You usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage through the use of special abilities and actions. The GM can also decide that circumstances grant Advantage or impose Disadvantage.

> ### Heroic inspiration
>
> Sometimes the GM or a rule gives you Heroic Inspiration. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll.
>
> **Only One at a Time.** You can never have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something gives you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it, you can give it to a player character in your group who lacks it.
>
> **Gaining Heroic Inspiration.** Your GM can give you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you do something particularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It’s a reward for making the game more fun for everyone playing.
>
> Other rules might allow your character to gain Heroic Inspiration independent of the GM’s decision. For example, Human characters start each day with Heroic Inspiration.

#### Roll Two D20s

When a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage, roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For example, if you have Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a 3, use the 3. If you instead have Advantage and roll those numbers, use the 18.

#### They Don’t Stack

If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Similarly, if multiple situations impose Disadvantage on a roll, you roll only two d20s.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advantage and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither Advantage nor Disadvantage.

#### Interactions with Rerolls

When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and something in the game lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one die, not both. You choose which one.

For example, if you have Heroic Inspiration (see the sidebar below) and roll a 3 and an 18 on an ability check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one of those dice, not both of them.

## Proficiency

Characters and monsters are good at various things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while others can use only a few. Some are better at understanding people’s motives, and others are better at unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature’s capabilities. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels (described in “Character Creation”). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based on its Challenge Rating (see “Rules Glossary”). The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined.

This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.

Table: Proficiency Bonus

| Level or CR | Bonus |
|-------------|-------|
| Up to 4     | +2    |
| 5–8         | +3    |
| 9–12        | +4    |
| 13–16       | +5    |
| 17–20       | +6    |
| 21–24       | +7    |
| 25–28       | +8    |
| 29–30       | +9    |

### The Bonus Doesn’t Stack

Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you’re proficient in either skill, but you don’t add it twice if you’re proficient in both skills.

Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the Expertise feature (see “Rules Glossary”) doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once.

### Skill Proficiencies 

Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take (see “Actions” later in “Playing the Game”) specify which skill applies if you make an ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is relevant. The GM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.

If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a creature can still make ability checks involving that skill but doesn’t add its Proficiency Bonus. For example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character has Athletics proficiency, the character adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.

Table: Skills

| Skill           | Ability      | Example Uses                                                              |

| Animal Handling | Wisdom       | Calm or train an animal, or get an animal to behave in a certain way.     |
| Arcana          | Intelligence | Recall lore about spells, magic items, and the planes of existence.       |
| Athletics       | Strength     | Jump farther than normal, stay afloat in rough water, or break something. |
| Deception       | Charisma     | Tell a convincing lie, or wear a disguise convincingly.                   |
| History         | Intelligence | Recall lore about historical events, people, nations, and cultures.       | 
| Insight         | Wisdom       | Discern a person’s mood and intentions.                                   |
| Intimidation    | Charisma     | Awe or threaten someone into doing what you want.                         |
| Investigation   | Intelligence | Find obscure information in books, or deduce how something works.         |
| Medicine        | Wisdom       | Diagnose an illness, or determine what killed the recently slain.         |
| Nature          | Intelligence | Recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, and weather.                  |
| Perception      | Wisdom       | Using a combination of senses, notice something that’s easy to miss.      |
| Performance     | Charisma     | Act, tell a story, perform music, or dance.                               |
| Persuasion      | Charisma     | Honestly and graciously convince someone of something.                    |
| Religion        | Intelligence | Recall lore about gods, religious rituals, and holy symbols.              |
| Sleight of Hand | Dexterity    | Pick a pocket, conceal a handheld object, or perform legerdemain.         |
| Stealth         | Dexterity    | Escape notice by moving quietly and hiding behind things.                 |
| Survival        | Wisdom       | Follow tracks, forage, find a trail, or avoid natural hazards.            |

#### Skill List

The skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes example uses for each skill proficiency as well as the ability check the skill most often applies to.

#### Determining Skills

A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in its stat block.

### Saving Throw Proficiencies

Proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add
their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a partic-
ular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom
saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your
Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving
throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.
  Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving
throws, representing that class’s training in evading
or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example,
are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves;
they train to resist mental assault.

### Equipment Proficiencies

A character gains proficiency with various weapons and tools from their class and background. There are two categories of equipment proficiency:

**Weapons.** Anyone can wield a weapon, but proficiency makes you better at wielding it. If you have proficiency with a weapon, you add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.

**Tools.** If you have proficiency with a tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have profciency in the skill that’s also used with that check, you have Advantage on the check too. This means you can benefit from both skill proficiency and tool proficiency on the same ability check.

## Actions

When you do something other than moving or communicating, you typically take an action. The Action table lists the game’s main actions, which are defined in more detail in “Rules Glossary.”

Table: Actions

| Action    | Summary |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attack    | Attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.                                        |
| Dash      | For the rest of the turn, give yourself extra movement equal to your Speed.       |
| Disengage | Your movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.       |
| Dodge     | Until the start of your next turn, attack rolls against you have Disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throws with Advantage. You lose this benefit if you have the Incapacitated condition or if your Speed is 0. |
| Help      | Help another creature’s ability check or attack roll, or administer first aid.    |
| Hide      | Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.                                                 |
| Influence | Make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to alter a creature’s attitude. |
| Magic     | Cast a spell, use a magic item, or use a magical feature.                         |
| Ready     | Prepare to take an action in response to a trigger you define.                    |
| Search    | Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine, Perception, or Survival) check.                 |
| Study     | Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion) check. |
| Utilize   | Use a nonmagical object.                                                          |

Player characters and monsters can also do things not covered by these actions. Many class features and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the Game Master tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to make, if any.

### One Thing at a Time

The game uses actions to govern how much you can do at one time. You can take only one action at a time. This principle is most important in combat, as explained in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”

Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a social interaction, you can try to Influence a creature or use the Search action to read the creature’s body language, but you can’t do both at the same time. And when you’re exploring a dungeon, you can’t simultaneously use the Search action to look for traps and use the Help action to aid another character who’s trying to open a stuck door (with the Utilize action).

### Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability, a spell, or another feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action. You otherwise don’t have a Bonus Action to take.

You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn, so you must choose which Bonus Action to use if you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a Bonus Action during your turn unless the Bonus Action’s timing is specified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus Action.

### Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a Reaction. A Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The Opportunity Attack, described later in “Playing the Game,” is the most common type of Reaction.

When you take a Reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the Reaction.

In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immediately after its trigger unless the Reaction’s description says otherwise.

## Social Interaction

During their adventures, player characters meet many different people and face some monsters that would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it’s time for social interaction, which takes many forms. For example, you might try to convince a burglar to confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The Game Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer characters who are participating.

An NPC’s attitude toward your character is Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile, as defined in “Rules Glossary.” Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help, and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder.

Social interactions progress in two ways: through roleplaying and ability checks.

### Roleplaying

Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions.

As you roleplay, consider whether you prefer an active approach or a descriptive approach.

The GM uses an NPC’s personality and your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant refuses to help if the characters badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.

When interacting with an NPC, pay attention to the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s personality. You might be able to learn an NPC’s goals and then use that information to influence the NPC.

If you offer NPCs something they want or play on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can form friendships, ward off violence, or learn a key piece of information. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will likely fail.

### Ability Checks

Ability checks can be key in determining the outcome of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance if the GM wants dice to play a role in determining an NPC’s response to you. In such situations, the GM will typically ask you to take the Influence action.

Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you will interact with an NPC; use an approach that relies on your group’s skill proficiencies. For example, if the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue who is proficient in Deception should lead the discussion.

## Exploration

Exploration involves delving into places that are dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this section detail some of the ways adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

### Adventuring Equipment

As adventurers explore, their equipment can help them in many ways. For example, they can reach out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things they wouldn’t otherwise notice with a Torch or another light source, bypass locked doors and containers with Thieves’ Tools, and create obstacles for pursuers with Caltrops.

See “Equipment” for rules on many items that are useful on adventures. The items in the“Tools” and “Adventuring Gear” sections are especially useful. The weapons in “Equipment” can also be used for more than battle; you could use a Quarterstaff, for example, to push a sinister-looking button that you’re reluctant to touch.

### Vision and Light

Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing danger, hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells—are affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can hinder you, as explained below.

#### Obscured Areas

An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage—you have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A Heavily Obscured area—such as an area with Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage—is opaque. You have the Blinded condition (see “Rules Glossary”) when trying to see something there.

#### Light

The presence or absence of light determines the category of illumination in an area, as defined below.

**Bright Light.** Bright Light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim Light.** Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might bathe the land in Dim Light.

**Darkness.**

Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.

#### Special Senses

Some creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations. “Rules Glossary” defines the following special senses:

* Blindsight
* Darkvision
* Tremorsense
* Truesight

### Hiding

Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an ambush. The Game Master decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, you take the Hide action.

### Interacting with Objects

Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve. The player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the GM describes what happens. Sometimes, however, rules govern what you can do with an object, as detailed in the following sections.

#### What Is an Object?

For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone. It isn’t a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects.

#### Time-Limited Object Interactions

When time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature’s movement or action. Any additional interactions require the Utilize action, as explained in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”

#### Finding Hidden Objects

When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object, other important details, or both.

If you describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total.

#### Carrying Objects

You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the GM might require you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in “Rules Glossary.”

#### Breaking Objects

As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to damage something more resilient, the GM might use the rules on breaking objects in “Rules Glossary.”

> Marching Order
> The adventurers should establish a marching order while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change your marching order outside combat and record the order any way you like: write it down, for example, or arrange miniatures to show it.

### Hazards

Monsters are the main perils characters face, but other dangers await. “Rules Glossary” defines the following hazards:

* Burning
* Dehydration
* Falling
* Malnutrition
* Suffocation

### Travel

During an adventure, the characters might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The GM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the GM might have you use the travel pace rules below.

If you need to know how fast you can move when every second matters, see the movement rules in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”

#### Travel Pace

While traveling outside combat, a group can move at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time; if riding horses or other mounts, the group can move twice that distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a Short or Long Rest before they can move at that increased pace again (see “Equipment” for a selection of mounts for sale). “Gameplay Toolbox” has rules that affect which pace you can choose in certain types of terrain.

Table: Travel Pace - Distance Traveled Per …
| Pace   | Minute   | Hour    | Day      |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| Fast   | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles |
| Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles |
| Slow   | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles |


Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.

**Fast.** Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvantage on a traveler’s Wisdom (Perception or Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Normal.** Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Slow.** Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks.

#### Vehicles

Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t choose a travel pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. “Equipment” includes vehicles for sale.

## Combat

Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat often breaks out.

### The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated.

#### Combat Step by Step

Combat unfolds in these steps:

1. **Establish Positions.** The Game Master determines where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are—how far away and in what direction.

2. **Roll Initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.

3. **Take Turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops.

#### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that determines their place in the Initiative order. The GM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical creatures, the GM makes a single roll, so each member of the group has the same Initiative.

**Surprise.** If a combatant is surprised by combat starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their Initiative roll. For example, if an ambusher starts combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.

**Initiative Order.** A combatant’s check total is called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short. The GM ranks the combatants, from highest to lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act during each round. The Initiative order remains the same from round to round.

**Ties.** If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied monsters, and the players decide the order among tied characters. The GM decides the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character.

#### Your Turn

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your Speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first.

The main actions you can take are listed in “Actions” earlier in “Playing the Game.” A character’s features and a monster’s stat block also provide action options. “Movement and Position” later in “Playing the Game” gives the rules for movement.

**Communicating.** You can communicate however you are able—through brief utterances and gestures—as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither your action nor your move.

Extended communication, such as a detailed explanation of something or an attempt to persuade a foe, requires an action. The Influence action is the main way you try to influence a monster.

**Interacting with Things.** You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to take the Utilize action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

> ### Playing on a Grid
>
>If you play using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.
>
> **Squares.** Each square represents 5 feet.
>
> **Speed.** Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid, using your Speed in 5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of 30 feet translates into 6 squares. If you use a grid often, consider writing your Speed in squares on your character sheet.
>
> **Entering a Square.** To enter a square, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering. It costs 1 square of movement to enter an unoccupied square that’s adjacent to your space (orthogonally or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain costs 2 squares to enter. Other effects might make a square cost even more.
>
> **Corners.** Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature that fills its space.
>
> **Ranges.** To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—count squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.

The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM might require you to take the Utilize action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

**Doing Nothing on Your Turn.** You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do, consider taking the defensive Dodge action or the Ready action to delay acting.

#### Ending Combat

Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated, which can mean the creatures are killed or knocked out or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also end when both sides agree to end it.

### Movement and Position

On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your Speed or less. Or you can decide not to move.

Your movement can include climbing, crawling, jumping, and swimming (each explained in “Rules Glossary”). These different modes of movement can be combined with your regular movement, or they can constitute your entire move.

However you’re moving with your Speed, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from it until it is used up or until you are done moving, whichever comes first.

A character’s Speed is determined during character creation. A monster’s Speed is noted in the monster’s stat block. See “Rules Glossary” for more about Speed as well as about special speeds, such as a Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combatants are often slowed down by Difficult Terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of Difficult Terrain.

Every foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs 1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count as Difficult Terrain.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your move, using some of its movement before and after any action, Bonus Action, or Reaction you take on the same turn. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 feet, you could go 10 feet, take an action, and then go 20 feet.

#### Dropping Prone

On your turn, you can give yourself the Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) without using an action or any of your Speed, but you can’t do so if your Speed is 0.

#### Creature Size

A creature belongs to a size category, which determines the width of the square space the creature occupies on a map, as shown on the Creature Size and Space table. That table lists the sizes from smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A creature’s space is the area that it effectively controls in combat and the area it needs to fight effectively.

A character’s size is determined by species, and a monster’s size is specified in the monster’s stat block.

Table: Creature Size and Space

| Size       | Space (Feet)  | Space (Squares)     |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ feet | 4 per square        |
| Small      | 5 by 5 feet   | 1 square            |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 feet   | 1 square            |
| Large      | 10 by 10 feet | 4 squares (2 by 2)  |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 feet | 9 squares (3 by 3)  |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 feet | 16 squares (4 by 4) |

#### Moving around Other Creatures

During your move, you can pass through the space of an ally, a creature that has the Incapacitated
condition (see “Rules Glossary”), a Tiny creature, or a creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than
you.

Another creature’s space is Difficult Terrain for you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally.

You can’t willingly end a move in a space occupied by another creature. If you somehow end a turn in
a space with another creature, you have the Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) unless you are Tiny or are of a larger size than the other creature.

### Making an Attack

When you take the Attack action, you make an attack. Some other actions, Bonus Actions, and Reactions also let you make an attack. Whether you strike with a Melee weapon, fire a Ranged weapon, or make an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has the following structure:

> ### Unseen Attackers and Targets
>
> When you make an attack roll against a target you can’t see, you have Disadvantage on the roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you miss.
>
> When a creature can’t see you, you have Advantage on attack rolls against it.
> If you are hidden when you make an attack roll, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

1. **Choose a Target.** Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.

2. **Determine Modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has Cover (see the next section) and whether you have Advantage or Disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.

3. **Resolve the Attack.** Make the attack roll, as detailed earlier in “Playing the Game.” On a hit, you roll damage unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

### Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover, making a target more difficult to harm. As detailed in the Cover table, there are three degrees of cover, each of which gives a different benefit to a target.

A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives HalfCover and a tree trunk that gives Three-Quarters Cover, the target has Three-Quarters Cover.

Table: Cover

| Degree         | Benefit to Target                          | Offered By … |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Half           | +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws | Another creature or an object that covers at least half of the target |
| Three Quarters | +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws | An object that covers at least three-quarters of the target |
| Total          | Can’t be targeted directly                 | An object that covers the whole target |

### Ranged Attacks

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow,
hurl an axe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a
foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a
ranged attack.

#### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets
within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as
one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t
attack a target beyond this range.

  Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a
Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is
the normal range, and the larger number is the long
range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your
target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack
a target beyond long range.

#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe
is next to you. When you make a ranged attack roll
with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you
have Disadvantage on the roll if you are within 5
feet of an enemy who can see you and doesn’t have
the Incapacitated condition (see “Rules Glossary”).

### Melee Attacks

A melee attack allows you to attack a target within
your reach. A melee attack typically uses a hand-
held weapon or an Unarmed Strike. Many monsters
make melee attacks with claws, teeth, or other body
parts. A few spells also involve melee attacks.

#### Reach

A creature has a 5-foot reach and can thus attack
targets within 5 feet when making a melee attack.
Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach
greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

#### Opportunity Attacks

Combatants watch for enemies to drop their guard.
If you move heedlessly past your foes, you put your-
self in danger by provoking an Opportunity Attack.

**Avoiding Opportunity Attacks.** You can avoid
provoking an Opportunity Attack by taking the
Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an Oppor-
tunity Attack when you Teleport or when you are
moved without using your movement, action, Bonus
Action, or Reaction. For example, you don’t provoke
an Opportunity Attack if an explosion hurls you out
of a foe’s reach or if you fall past an enemy.

**Making an Opportunity Attack.** You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can
see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike against that creature. The attack occurs right before it leaves your reach.

### Mounted Combat

A willing creature that is at least one size larger
than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy
can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

#### Mounting and Dismounting

During your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your Speed (round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet, you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.

#### Controlling a Mount

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and similar creatures have such training.

The Initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves on your turn as you direct it, and it has only three action options during that turn: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

In contrast, an independent mount—one that lets you ride but ignores your control—retains its place in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes.

#### Falling Off

If an effect is about to move your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off, landing with the Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mount.

While mounted, you must make the same save if you’re knocked Prone or the mount is.

### Underwater Combat

A fight underwater follows these rules.

#### Impeded Weapons

When making a melee attack roll with a weapon
underwater, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed has
Disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon
deals Piercing damage.
  A ranged attack roll with a weapon underwater
automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s
normal range, and the attack roll has Disadvantage
against a target within normal range.

#### Fire Resistance

Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire damage (explained in “Damage and Healing”).

## Damage and Healing

Injury and death are frequent threats, as detailed in
the following rules.

### Hit Points

Hit Points represent durability and the will to live. Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of

Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current Hit Points can be any number from that maximum down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go.

Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capabilities until you reach 0 Hit Points.

If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you’re Bloodied, which has no game effect on its own but which might trigger other game effects.

> Resting
>
> Adventurers can’t spend every hour adventuring. They need rest. Any creature can take hour-long Short Rests in the midst of a day and an 8-hour Long Rest to end it. Regaining Hit Points is one of the main benefits of a rest. “Rules Glossary” provides the rules for Short and Long Rests.

### Damage Rolls

Each weapon, spell, and damaging monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage dice, add any modifiers, and deal the damage to your target. If there’s a penalty to the damage, it’s possible to deal 0 damage but not negative damage.

When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don’t add your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that doesn’t use a roll, such as the damage of a Blowgun. See “Equipment” for weapons’ damage dice and “Spells” for spells’ damage dice.

### Critical Hits

When you score a Critical Hit, you deal extra damage. Roll the attack’s damage dice twice, add them together, and add any relevant modifiers as normal. For example, if you score a Critical Hit with a Dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage rather than 1d4, and add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the Rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you also roll those dice twice.

### Saving Throws and Damage

Damage dealt via saving throws uses these rules.

#### Damage against Multiple Targets

When you create a damaging effect that forces two or more targets to make saving throws against it at the same time, roll the damage once for all the targets. For example, when a wizard casts Fireball, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

#### Half Damage

Many saving throw effects deal half damage (round down) to a target when the target succeeds on the saving throw. The halved damage is equal to half the damage that would be dealt on a failed save.

### Damage Types

Each instance of damage has a type, like Fire or Slashing. Damage types are listed in “Rules Glossary” and have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as Resistance, rely on damage types.

### Resistance and Vulnerability 

Some creatures and objects have Resistance or Vulnerability to certain damage types. If you have Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against you (round down). If you have Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against you. For example, if you have Resistance to Cold damage, such damage is halved against you, and if you have Vulnerability to Fire damage, such damage is doubled against you.

#### No Stacking

Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if you have Resistance to Necrotic damage as well as Resistance to all damage, Necrotic damage is reduced by half against you.

#### Order of Application

Modifiers to damage are applied in the following order: adjustments such as bonuses, penalties, or multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied second; and Vulnerability is applied third.

For example, a creature has Resistance to all damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it’s within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. If it takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first reduced by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature’s Resistance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for its Vulnerability (to 22).

### Immunity

Some creatures and objects have Immunity to certain damage types and conditions. Immunity to a damage type means you don’t take damage of that type, and Immunity to a condition means you aren’t affected by it.

### Healing
Hit Points can be restored by magic, such as the *Cure Wounds* or by a *Potion of Healing*,  spell or a Short or Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”).

When you receive healing, add the restored Hit Points to your current Hit Points. Your Hit Points can’t exceed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit Points regained in excess of the maximum are lost. For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of 20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8.

> Knocking out a Creature
>
> When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious condition. It then starts a Short Rest, at the end of which that condition ends on it. The condition ends early if the creature regains any Hit Points or if someone takes an action to administer first aid to it, making a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.

#### Instant Death

Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly.

**Monster Death.** A monster dies the instant it drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Game Master can ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat it like a character.

**Hit Point Maximum of 0.** A creature dies if its Hit Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life energy, reducing a creature’s Hit Point maximum.

**Massive Damage.** When damage reduces a character to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the character dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to 0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.

#### Character Demise

If your character dies, others might find a magical way to revive your character, such as with the *Raise Dead* spell. Or talk with the GM about making a new character to join the group. “Rules Glossary” has more information on being dead.

#### Falling Unconscious

If you reach 0 Hit Points and don’t die instantly, you have the Unconscious condition (see “Rules Glos- sary”) until you regain any Hit Points, and you now face making Death Saving Throws (see below).

#### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points, you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to an ability score. You’re in the hands of fate now.

**Three Successes/Failures.** Roll 1d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become Stable (see “Stabilizing a Character” below). On your third failure, you die.

The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.

**Rolling a 1 or 20.** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point.

**Damage at 0 Hit Points.** If you take any damage while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Saving Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.

#### Stabilizing a Character

You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A Stable creature doesn’t make Death Saving Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes damage, it stops being Stable and starts making Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.

### Temporary Hit Points

Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit Points, as explained below.

#### Lose Temporary Hit Points First

If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage, those points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your Hit Points. For example, if you have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage, you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points.

#### Duration

Temporary Hit Points last until they’re depleted or you finish a Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”).

#### They Don’t Stack

Temporary Hit Points can’t be added together. If you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

#### They’re Not Hit Points or Healing

Temporary Hit Points can’t be added to your Hit Points, healing can’t restore them, and receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn’t count as healing. Because Temporary Hit Points aren’t Hit Points, a creature can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary Hit Points.

If you have 0 Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn’t restore you to consciousness. Only true healing can save you.

You'll record the main details of your character on a character sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use the term "character sheet" to mean whatever you use to track your character's details, whether it's a printed character sheet, a digital character sheet, or plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works for you, and then embark on creating a character!

## Create Your Character

Here are the steps to make a character; each step is explored in detail:

1. **Choose a Class.** Every adventurer is a member of a class. A class broadly describes a character's vocation, special talents, and favored tactics.
2. **Determine Origin.** A character's origin includes two elements: background and species. How did the character spend the years leading up to a life of adventure? Who are the character's ancestors? You can also choose your character's languages.
3. **Determine Ability Scores.** Much of what your character does in the game depends on the character's six abilities.
4. **Choose an Alignment.** Alignment is a shorthand for your character's moral compass.
5. **Fill in Details.** Using the choices you've made, fill in the remaining details on your character sheet.

### Step 1: Choose Class

Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet. The Class Overview table summarizes the classes. See "Classes" for the classes' details.

Table: Class Overview

| Class     | Likes             | Primary Ability          | Complexity |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Barbarian | Battle            | Strength                 | Average    |
| Bard      | Performing        | Charisma                 | High       |
| Cleric    | Gods              | Wisdom                   | Average    |
| Druid     | Nature            | Wisdom                   | High       |
| Fighter   | Weapons           | Strength or Dexterity    | Low        |
| Monk      | Unarmed combat    | Dexterity and Wisdom     | High       |
| Paladin   | Defense           | Strength and Charisma    | Average    |
| Ranger    | Survival          | Dexterity and Wisdom     | Average    |
| Rogue     | Stealth           | Dexterity                | Low        |
| Sorcerer  | Power             | Charisma                 | High       |
| Warlock   | Occult lore       | Charisma                 | High       |
| Wizard    | Spellbooks        | Intelligence             | Average    |

#### Write Your Level

Write your character's level on your character sheet. Typically, a character starts at level 1 and advances in level by adventuring and gaining Experience Points (XP).

**Write Your XP.** Also record your Experience Points. A level 1 character has 0 XP.

**Starting at a Higher Level.** Your GM might start you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher, write your chosen subclass on your character sheet. See the "Starting at Higher Levels" section later in "Character Creation" for more information.

#### Note Armor Training

Your class might give you training with certain categories of armor. Note your armor training on your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of armor means you can wear that armor effectively, gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of armor are described in "Equipment."

### Step 2: Character Origin

Determining your character's origin involves choosing a background, a species, and two languages.

A character's background represents the place and occupation that were most formative for the character. The combination of background, species, and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination as you ponder your character's earliest days.

#### Choose a Background

Choose your character's background, and write it on your character sheet. You can choose any of the backgrounds detailed in "Character Origins," and your GM might offer additional backgrounds as options.

The background you choose influences step 3, when you determine your character's ability scores. If you're having trouble choosing, the Ability Scores and Backgrounds table shows which backgrounds benefit which ability scores. Look for your class's primary ability there.

Table: Ability Scores and Backgrounds

| Ability      | Background |
|--------------|------------|
| Strength     | Soldier    |
| Dexterity    | Soldier    |
| Constitution | Soldier    |
| Intelligence | Acolyte    |
| Wisdom       | Acolyte    |
| Charisma     | Acolyte    |

**Record Your Feat.** A background gives you a feat, which grants your character particular capabilities. Feats are detailed in "Feats." Write the feat on your character sheet.

**Note Proficiencies.** Your background gives proficiency in two skills and with one tool. Record this information on your character sheet.

Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your class description in "Classes" and note the proficiencies on your character sheet.

The features table in your class description shows your Proficiency Bonus (described in "Playing the Game"), which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this number on your character sheet. You'll fill in other numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5.

#### Choose Starting Equipment

Your background and class both provide starting equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step can be immediately spent on equipment from "Equipment."

Record your chosen equipment on your character sheet. Equipment is described in "Equipment," but for now you can just write it all down and look up the specifics in "Equipment" later. Note any coins you have left after purchasing your equipment.

#### Choose a Species

Choose a species for your character. The following species options are detailed in "Character Origins": Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you've chosen a species, write it on your character sheet. Then record your species' traits.

Your character's size and Speed are determined by the character's species; record these in the appropriate places on your character sheet as well (you may write just the first letter of your size).

#### Imagine Your Past and Present

Let your character's background and species inspire how you imagine their past. That past fed into the character's present. With that in mind, consider answers to the following questions as your character:

- Who raised you?
- Who was your dearest childhood friend?
- Did you grow up with a pet?
- Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
- Did you join an organization, such as a guild or religion? If so, are you still a member of it?
- What elements of your past inspire you to go on adventures now?

#### Choose Languages

Your character knows at least three languages: Common plus two languages you roll or choose from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a language means your character can communicate in it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features might also give you languages.

The Standard Languages table lists languages that are widespread in the setting. Every player character knows Common. The other standard languages originated with the first members of the most prominent species in the setting and have since spread widely.

Table: Standard Languages

| 1d12  | Language             |
|-------|----------------------|
| —     | Common               |
| 1     | Common Sign Language |
| 2     | Draconic             |
| 3–4   | Dwarvish             |
| 5–6   | Elvish               |
| 7     | Giant                |
| 8     | Gnomish              |
| 9     | Goblin               |
| 10–11 | Halfling             |
| 12    | Orc                  |

The Rare Languages table lists languages that are either secret or derived from other planes of existence and thus less widespread in the worlds of the Material Plane. Some features let a character learn a rare language.

Table: Rare Languages

| Language    | Language      |
|-------------|---------------|
| Abyssal     | Primordial*   |
| Celestial   | Sylvan        |
| Deep Speech | Thieves' Cant |
| Druidic     | Undercommon   |
| Infernal    |               |

\*Primordial includes the Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran dialects. Creatures that know one of these dialects can communicate with those that know a different one.

### Step 3: Ability Scores

To determine your character's ability scores, you first generate a set of six numbers using the instructions below and then assign them to your six abilities. "Playing the Game" explains what each ability means.

#### Generate Your Scores

Determine your ability scores by using one of the following three methods. Your GM might prefer you to use a particular one.

**Standard Array.** Use the following six scores for your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

**Random Generation.** Roll four d6s and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times, so you have six numbers.

**Point Cost.** You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Costs table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 of your 27 points.

Table: Ability Score Point Costs

| Score | Cost | Score | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| 8     | 0    | 12    | 4    |
| 9     | 1    | 13    | 5    |
| 10    | 2    | 14    | 7    |
| 11    | 3    | 15    | 9    |

#### Assign Ability Scores

Once you've generated six scores, assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class's primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.

If you're using the Standard Array option, consult the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions on where to assign scores for your character's class. The table puts the highest scores in a class's main abilities. If you used a different method to generate the scores, you may still use this table to guide where you place your highest and lowest scores.

Table: Standard Array by Class

| Class     | Str. | Dex. | Con. | Int. | Wis. | Cha. |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Barbarian | 15   | 13   | 14   | 10   | 12   | 8    |
| Bard      | 8    | 14   | 12   | 13   | 10   | 15   |
| Cleric    | 14   | 8    | 13   | 10   | 15   | 12   |
| Druid     | 8    | 12   | 14   | 13   | 15   | 10   |
| Fighter   | 15   | 14   | 13   | 8    | 10   | 12   |
| Monk      | 12   | 15   | 13   | 10   | 14   | 8    |
| Paladin   | 15   | 10   | 13   | 8    | 12   | 14   |
| Ranger    | 12   | 15   | 13   | 8    | 14   | 10   |
| Rogue     | 12   | 15   | 13   | 14   | 10   | 8    |
| Sorcerer  | 10   | 13   | 14   | 8    | 12   | 15   |
| Warlock   | 8    | 14   | 13   | 12   | 10   | 15   |
| Wizard    | 8    | 12   | 13   | 15   | 14   | 10   |

#### Adjust Ability Scores

After assigning your ability scores, adjust them according to your background. Your background lists three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20.

Some players like to increase their class's primary ability, while others prefer to increase a low score.

#### Determine Ability Modifiers

Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

Table: Ability Scores and Modifiers

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| 3     | −4       | 12–13 | +1       |
| 4–5   | −3       | 14–15 | +2       |
| 6–7   | −2       | 16–17 | +3       |
| 8–9   | −1       | 18–19 | +4       |
| 10–11 | +0       | 20    | +5       |

### Step 4: Alignment

Choose your character's alignment from the options below, and note it on your character sheet.

The game assumes that player characters aren't of an evil alignment. Check with your GM before making an evil character.

#### The Nine Alignments

A creature's alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).

The summaries of the alignments below describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; individuals can vary from that behavior.

**Lawful Good (LG).** Lawful Good creatures endeavor to do the right thing as expected by society. Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.

**Neutral Good (NG).** Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them. A kindly person who helps others according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.

**Chaotic Good (CG).** Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron's tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the poor is probably Chaotic Good.

**Lawful Neutral (LN).** Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life—and isn't swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil—is probably Lawful Neutral.

**Neutral (N).** Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Someone who's bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.

**Chaotic Neutral (CN).** Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.

**Lawful Evil (LE).** Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably Lawful Evil.

**Neutral Evil (NE).** Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.

**Chaotic Evil (CE).** Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.

> ### Unaligned Creatures
>
>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought don't have alignments; they are unaligned. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they aren't evil; they are unaligned.


### Step 5: Character Creation Details

Now fill in the rest of your character sheet.

#### Record Class Features

Look at your class's feature table in "Classes," and write down the level 1 features. The class features are detailed there too.

Some class features offer choices. Make sure to read all your features and make any offered choices.

#### Fill In Numbers

Note these numbers on your character sheet.

**Saving Throws.** For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total. Some players also like to note the modifier for saving throws they're not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.

**Skills.** For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total. You might also wish to note the modifier for skills you're not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.

**Passive Perception.** Sometimes your GM will determine whether your character notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check; the GM uses your Passive Perception instead. Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general awareness of your surroundings when you're not actively looking for something. Use this formula to determine your Passive Perception score:

*Passive Perception* = 10 + Wisdom (Perception) check modifier

Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom (Perception) checks. For example, if your character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).

**Hit Points.** Your class and Constitution modifier determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as shown on the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table.

Table: Level 1 Hit Points by Class

| Class                                           | Hit Point Maximum  |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Barbarian                                       | 12 + Con. modifier |
| Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger                     | 10 + Con. modifier |
| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock    | 8 + Con. modifier  |
| Sorcerer or Wizard                              | 6 + Con. modifier  |

The character sheet includes room to note your current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There's also space to track Death Saving Throws.

**Hit Point Dice.** Your class's description tells you the die type of your character's Hit Point Dice (or Hit Dice for short); write this on your character sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space to note how many Hit Dice you've spent.

**Initiative.** Write your Dexterity modifier in the space for Initiative on your character sheet.

**Armor Class.** Without armor or a shield, your base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in "Equipment." A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC.

**Attacks.** In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips section of the character sheet, write your starting weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with which you have proficiency is one of the following unless a weapon's property says otherwise:

*Melee attack bonus* = Strength modifier + Proficiency Bonus 

*Ranged attack bonus* = Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus

Look up the damage and properties of your weapons in "Equipment." You add the same ability modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your damage rolls with that weapon.

**Spellcasting.** Note both the saving throw DC for your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you make with them, using these formulas:

*Spell save DC* = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus

*Spell attack bonus* = spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus

Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is determined by whatever feature gives you the ability to cast the spell.

**Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells.** If your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, your class features table shows the number of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips you know, and how many spells you can prepare. Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note them—along with your number of spell slots—on your character sheet.

## Level Advancement

While going on adventures, your character gains experience, represented by Experience Points (XP). A character who reaches a specified Experience Point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.

The Character Advancement table lists the XP you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience Points column, you reach the corresponding level.

Table: Character Advancement

| Level | Experience Points | Proficiency Bonus |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1     | 0                 | +2                |
| 2     | 300               | +2                |
| 3     | 900               | +2                |
| 4     | 2,700             | +2                |
| 5     | 6,500             | +3                |
| 6     | 14,000            | +3                |
| 7     | 23,000            | +3                |
| 8     | 34,000            | +3                |
| 9     | 48,000            | +4                |
| 10    | 64,000            | +4                |
| 11    | 85,000            | +4                |
| 12    | 100,000           | +4                |
| 13    | 120,000           | +5                |
| 14    | 140,000           | +5                |
| 15    | 165,000           | +5                |
| 16    | 195,000           | +5                |
| 17    | 225,000           | +6                |
| 18    | 265,000           | +6                |
| 19    | 305,000           | +6                |
| 20    | 355,000           | +6                |

### Gaining a Level

When you gain a level, follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Class.** Most characters advance in the same class. However, you might decide to gain a level in another class using the rules in the "Multiclassing" section.
2. **Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice.** Each time you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die. Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points by Class table.

Table: Fixed Hit Points by Class

| Class                                           | Hit Points per Level |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Barbarian                                       | 7 + Con. modifier    |
| Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger                     | 6 + Con. modifier    |
| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock    | 5 + Con. modifier    |
| Sorcerer or Wizard                              | 4 + Con. modifier    |

3. **Record New Class Features.** Look at your class features table in "Classes," and note the features you gain at your new level in that class. Make any choices offered by a new feature.
4. **Adjust Proficiency Bonus.** A character's Proficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as shown in the Character Advancement table and your class features table in "Classes." When your Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the numbers on your character sheet that include your Proficiency Bonus.
5. **Adjust Ability Modifiers.** If you choose a feat that increases one or more of your ability scores, your ability modifier also changes if the new score is an even number. When that happens, adjust all the numbers on your character sheet that use that ability modifier. When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if a character reaches level 8 and increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18, the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The character's Hit Point maximum then increases by 8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reaching level 8.

### Tiers of Play

With each new level, characters acquire new capabilities that equip them to handle greater challenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of the game also changes, and the stakes of the campaign get higher. It's helpful to think of a character's (and a campaign's) arc in terms of four tiers of play, describing the journey from a level 1 character just beginning an adventuring career to the epic heights of level 20. These tiers don't have any rules associated with them; they point to the fact that the play experience evolves as characters gain levels.

#### Tier 1 (Levels 1–4)

In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers, though they are already set apart from the broader populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities. They learn their starting class features and choose a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a danger to local farmsteads or villages.

#### Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)

In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers. Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as *Fireball*, *Lightning Bolt*, and *Raise Dead*. Most weapon-focused classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in a round. The characters now face dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.

#### Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)

In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power that makes them special among adventurers. At level 11, many spellcasters learn reality-altering spells. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or to do more impressive things with those attacks. These adventurers often confront threats to whole regions.

#### Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)

At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.

## Starting at Higher Levels

Your GM might start your group's characters at a level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended to start at level 3 if your group is composed of seasoned D&D players.

### Creating Your Character

Creating a higher-level character uses the same character-creation steps outlined in this chapter and the rules for advancing beyond level 1 provided in the "Level Advancement" section. You begin with the minimum amount of XP required to reach your starting level. For example, if the GM starts you at level 10, you have 64,000 XP.

> ### **Bonus Feats at Level 20**
>
> A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after characters reach level 20 to provide greater power to characters who have no more levels to gain. With this approach, each character gains one feat of their choice for every 30,000 XP the character earns above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially appropriate for these bonus feats, but a player can choose any feat for which their level 20 character qualifies.

### **Starting Equipment**

The GM decides whether your character starts with more than the standard equipment for a level 1 character, possibly even one or more magic items. The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a guide for the GM.

Also, check with your GM about what equipment is available for you to buy with your starting money. For example, the firearms described in "Equipment" are too expensive for level 1 characters, but they might be available for purchase if your GM allows them.

Table: Starting Equipment at Higher Levels

## Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level instead of gaining a level in your current class. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in a single class.

### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher, since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.

### Experience Points

The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table in "Character Creation." For example, if you are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a Cleric.

### Hit Points and Hit Point Dice

You gain the Hit Points from your new class as described for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit Points for a class only when your total character level is 1.

Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice are the same die type, you can pool them together. For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5 Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, track them separately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin, for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table. For example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue, you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of the new class's starting proficiencies, as detailed in each class's description in "Classes."

### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing. Check the information about multiclassing included in each of your classes' descriptions.

Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting, and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.

#### Armor Class

If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor Class, you can benefit from only one at a time. For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk's Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer's Draconic Resilience feature must choose only one of those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.

#### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than one class, the features don't stack. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless you have a feature that says you can (such as the Fighter's Two Extra Attacks feature).

Similarly, the Warlock's Thirsting Blade invocation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature with your pact weapon, doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

#### Spellcasting

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, follow the rules for that class.

**Spells Prepared.** You determine what spells you can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example, you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as well as four Sorcerer cantrips).

Each spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell.

**Cantrips.** If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, unless the spell says otherwise.

**Spell Slots.** You determine your available spell slots by adding together the following:

- All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes
- Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and Ranger classes

Then look up this total level in the Level column of the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.

This table might give you spell slots of a higher level than the spells you prepare. You can use those slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like *Burning Hands*, has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level, you can use the enhanced effect as normal.

For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when determining your spell slots, counting all your levels as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four level 1 spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3 slots. However, you can't prepare any level 3 spells, nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do prepare—and potentially enhance their effects.

**Pact Magic.** If you have the Pact Magic feature from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic to cast spells you have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast Warlock spells you have prepared.

## Trinkets

When you make your character, you can roll once on the Trinkets table to gain a Tiny trinket, a simple item lightly touched by mystery. The GM might also use this table. It can help stock a room in a dungeon or fill a creature's pockets.

#### Level 1: Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.

You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

While active, your Rage follows the rules below. *Damage Resistance.* You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

**Rage Damage.** When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

**Strength Advantage.** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**No Concentration or Spells.** You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.

**Duration.** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:

- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

#### Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.

#### Level 2: Danger Sense

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.

#### Level 2: Reckless Attack

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.

#### Level 3: Barbarian Subclass

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.

### Level 3: Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Fast Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor.

#### Level 7: Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.

#### Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.

#### Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

**Forceful Blow.** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

**Hamstring Blow.** The target's Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time the most recent one.

#### Level 11: Relentless Rage

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.

#### Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.

**Staggering Blow.** The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can't make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.

**Sundering Blow.** Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.

#### Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.

#### Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.

#### Level 18: Indomitable Might

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.

#### Level 20: Primal Champion

You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

### Barbarian Subclass: Path of the Berserker

*Channel Rage into Violent Fury*

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them.

#### Level 3: Frenzy

If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the attack.

#### Level 6: Mindless Rage

You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions while your Rage is active. If you're Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you.

#### Level 10: Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

#### Level 14: Intimidating Presence

As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### Level 1: Bardic Inspiration

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

**Using Bardic Inspiration.** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.

**Number of Uses.** You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**At Higher Levels.** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. *Dancing Lights* and *Vicious Mockery* are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. *Charm Person*, *Color Spray*, *Dissonant Whispers*, and *Healing Word* are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

#### Level 2: Expertise

You gain Expertise (see "Rules Glossary") in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### Level 2: Jack of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn't otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

#### Level 3: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College of Lore subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Bard level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Font of Inspiration

You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.

#### Level 7: Countercharm

You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.

#### Level 10: Magical Secrets

You've learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class's section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.

#### Level 18: Superior Inspiration

When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.

#### Level 20: Words of Creation

You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the *Power Word Heal* and *Power Word Kill*  spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.

### Bard Spell List

This section presents the Bard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell's school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it's a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### **Bard Subclass: College of Lore**

*Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge*

Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college's members gather in libraries and universities to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

#### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

#### Level 3: Cutting Words

You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature's roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.

#### Level 6: Magical Discoveries

You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or any combination thereof (see a class's section for its spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Bard Features table.

You always have the chosen spells prepared, and whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of the spells with another spell that meets these requirements.

#### Level 14: Peerless Skill

When you make an ability check or attack roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn't expended.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. *Guidance*, *Sacred Flame*, and *Thaumaturgy* are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. *Bless*, *Cure Wounds*, *Guiding Bolt*, and *Shield of Faith* are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

#### Level 1: Divine Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**Protector.** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.

**Thaumaturge.** You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

#### Level 2: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.

You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

**Divine Spark.** As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).

You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).

**Turn Undead.** As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.

#### Level 3: Cleric Subclass

You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Cleric level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Sear Undead

Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll's total. This damage doesn't end the turn effect.

#### Level 7: Blessed Strikes

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).

**Divine Strike.** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).

**Potent Spellcasting.** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.

#### Level 10: Divine Intervention

You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn't require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes

The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.

**Divine Strike.** The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.

**Potent Spellcasting.** When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.

#### Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention

You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose *Wish* when you select a spell. If you do so, you can't use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.

### Cleric Spell List

This section presents the Cleric spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell's school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it's a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Cleric Subclass: Life Domain

*Soothe the Hurts of the World*

The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.

Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.

#### Level 3: Disciple of Life

When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot's level.

#### Level 3: Life Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Table: Life Domain Spells

| Cleric Level    | Prepared Spells                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 3               | Aid, Bless, Cure Wounds, Lesser Restoration    |
| 5               | Mass Healing Word, Revivify                    |
| 7               | Aura of Life, Death Ward                       |
| 9               | Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds          |

#### Level 3: Preserve Life

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.

#### Level 6: Blessed Healer

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot's level.

#### Level 17: Supreme Healing

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don't roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. *Druidcraft* and *Produce Flame* are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.

When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. *Animal Friendship*, *Cure Wounds*, *Faerie Fire*, and *Thunderwave* are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

#### Level 1: Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the *Speak with Animals* spell prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can't decipher it without magic.

#### Level 1: Primal Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**Magician.** You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

**Warden.** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.

#### Level 2: Wild Shape

The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see "Known Forms" below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.

**Number of Uses.** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.

**Known Forms.** You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see "Animals" in "Monsters" for stat block options). The **Rat**, **Riding Horse**, **Spider**, and **Wolf** are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.

When choosing known forms, you may look in other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master permits you to do so.

Table: Beast Shapes

| Druid Level    | Known Forms    | Max CR    | Fly Speed |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2              | 4              | 1/4       | No        |
| 4              | 6              | 1/2       | No        |
| 8              | 8              | 1         | Yes       |

**Rules While Shape-Shifted.** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:

- **Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.
- **Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.
- **No Spellcasting.** You can't cast spells, but shapeshifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.
- **Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.

#### Level 2: Wild Companion

You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the *Find Familiar* spell without Material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 3: Druid Subclass

You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle of the Land subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Druid level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Wild Resurgence

Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).

In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 7: Elemental Fury

The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.

**Potent Spellcasting.** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.

**Primal Strike.** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form's attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).

#### Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury

The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.

**Potent Spellcasting.** When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell's range increases by 300 feet.

**Primal Strike.** The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.

#### Level 18: Beast Spells

While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its Material component.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.

#### Level 20: Archdruid

The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.

**Evergreen Wild Shape.** Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.

**Nature Magician.** You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

**Longevity.** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.

### Druid Subclass: Circle of the Land

*Celebrate Connection to the Natural World*

The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.

#### Level 3: Circle of the Land Spells

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. Consult the table below that corresponds to the chosen type; you have the spells listed for your Druid level and lower prepared.

Table: Arid Land

| Druid Level | Circle Spells                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| 3           | Blur, Burning Hands, Fire Bolt |
| 5           | Fireball                       |
| 7           | Blight                         |
| 9           | Wall of Stone                  |

Table: Polar Land

| 9           | Insect Plague                     |

#### Level 3: Land's Aid

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.

The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).

#### Level 6: Natural Recovery

You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you do so again.

In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you're a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels' worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 10: Nature's Ward

You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you have Resistance to a damage type associated with your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature, as shown in the Nature's Ward table.

Table: Nature's Ward

| Land Type | Resistance | Land Type | Resistance |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Arid      | Fire       | Temperate | Lightning  |
| Polar     | Cold       | Tropical  | Poison     |

#### Level 14: Nature's Sanctuary

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear in a 15-foot Cube on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature's Ward while there.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.

#### Level 1: Fighting Style

You have honed your martial prowess and gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see "Feats"). Defense is recommended.

Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.

#### Level 1: Second Wind

You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the Fighter Features table.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

#### Level 2: Tactical Mind

You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success.

If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn't expended.

#### Level 3: Fighter Subclass

You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The Champion subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Fighter level or lower.

Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

#### Level 9: Indomitable

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest starting at level 13 and three times before a Long Rest starting at level 17.

#### Level 9: Tactical Master

When you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack.

#### Level 11: Two Extra Attacks

You can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Level 13: Studied Attacks

You study your opponents and learn from each attack you make. If you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Combat Prowess is recommended.

#### Level 20: Three Extra Attacks

You can attack four times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Fighter Subclass: Champion

*Pursue Physical Excellence in Combat*

A Champion focuses on the development of martial prowess in a relentless pursuit of victory. Champions combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows, withstand peril, and garner glory. Whether in athletic contests or bloody battle, Champions strive for the crown of the victor.

#### Level 3: Improved Critical

Your attack rolls with weapons and Unarmed Strikes can score a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

#### Level 3: Remarkable Athlete

Thanks to your athleticism, you have Advantage on Initiative rolls and Strength (Athletics) checks.

#### Level 10: Heroic Warrior

The thrill of battle drives you toward victory. During combat, you can give yourself Heroic Inspiration whenever you start your turn without it.

#### Level 15: Superior Critical

Your attack rolls with weapons and Unarmed Strikes can now score a Critical Hit on a roll of 18–20 on the d20.

#### Level 18: Survivor

You attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle, giving you these benefits.

**Defy Death.** You have Advantage on Death Saving Throws. Moreover, when you roll 18–20 on a Death Saving Throw, you gain the benefit of rolling a 20 on it.

**Heroic Rally.** At the start of each of your turns, you regain Hit Points equal to 5 plus your Constitution modifier if you are Bloodied and have at least 1 Hit Point.

#### Level 1: Martial Arts

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your Unarmed Strike and Monk weapons, which are the following:

- Simple Melee weapons
- Martial Melee weapons that have the Light property

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield.

**Bonus Unarmed Strike.** You can make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.

**Martial Arts Die.** You can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike or Monk weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk Features table.

**Dexterous Attacks.** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and Monk weapons. In addition, when you use the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.

#### Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.

#### Level 2: Monk's Focus

Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Monk Features table.

You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.

When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.

Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

**Flurry of Blows.** You can expend 1 Focus Point to make two Unarmed Strikes as a Bonus Action.

**Patient Defense.** You can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and the Dodge actions as a Bonus Action.

**Step of the Wind.** You can take the Dash action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and Dash actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

#### Level 2: Unarmored Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as shown on the Monk Features table.

#### Level 2: Uncanny Metabolism

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended Focus Points. When you do so, roll your Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Monk level plus the number rolled.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 3: Deflect Attacks

When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack's total damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack's force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn't behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

#### Level 3: Monk Subclass

You gain a Monk subclass of your choice. The Warrior of the Open Hand subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Monk levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Monk level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Monk levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 4: Slow Fall

You can take a Reaction when you fall to reduce any damage you take from the fall by an amount equal to five times your Monk level.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Stunning Strike

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 1 Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target's Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has Advantage.

#### Level 6: Empowered Strikes

Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.

#### Level 7: Evasion

When you're subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.

You don't benefit from this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.

#### Level 9: Acrobatic Movement

While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.

#### Level 10: Heightened Focus

Your Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind gain the following benefits.

**Flurry of Blows.** You can expend 1 Focus Point to use Flurry of Blows and make three Unarmed Strikes with it instead of two.

**Patient Defense.** When you expend a Focus Point to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

**Step of the Wind.** When you expend a Focus Point to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or smaller. You move the creature with you until the end of your turn. The creature's movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks.

#### Level 10: Self-Restoration

Through sheer force of will, you can remove one of the following conditions from yourself at the end of each of your turns: Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned.

In addition, forgoing food and drink doesn't give you levels of Exhaustion.

#### Level 13: Deflect Energy

You can now use your Deflect Attacks feature against attacks that deal any damage type, not just Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.

#### Level 14: Disciplined Survivor

Your physical and mental discipline grant you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll it, and you must use the new roll.

#### Level 15: Perfect Focus

When you roll Initiative and don't use Uncanny Metabolism, you regain expended Focus Points until you have 4 if you have 3 or fewer.

#### Level 18: Superior Defense

At the start of your turn, you can expend 3 Focus Points to bolster yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition. During that time, you have Resistance to all damage except Force damage.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.

#### Level 20: Body and Mind

You have developed your body and mind to new heights. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

### Monk Subclass: Warrior of the Open Hand

*Master Unarmed Combat Techniques*

Warriors of the Open Hand are masters of unarmed combat. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents and manipulate their own energy to protect themselves from harm.

#### Level 3: Open Hand Technique

Whenever you hit a creature with an attack granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.

**Addle.** The target can't make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.

**Push.** The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

**Topple.** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.

#### Level 6: Wholeness of Body

You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain a number of Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point regained).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 11: Fleet Step

When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that Bonus Action.

#### Level 17: Quivering Palm

You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take an action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no action required).

#### Level 1: Lay On Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class's description.

**Spell Slots.** The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+**. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. *Heroism* and *Searing Smite* are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

#### Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see "Feats" for feats). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

**Blessed Warrior.** You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class's section for a list of Cleric spells). *Guidance* and *Sacred Flame* are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.

#### Level 2: Paladin's Smite

You always have the *Divine Smite* spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.

#### Level 3: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.

You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

**Divine Sense.** As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *Hallow* spell.

> ### Breaking Your Oath
>
> A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.
>
> A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.
>
> If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your GM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.

#### Level 3: Paladin Subclass

You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Paladin level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Faithful Steed

You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the *Find Steed* spell prepared.

You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 6: Aura of Protection

You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.

You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.

#### Level 9: Abjure Foes

As a Magic action, you can expend one use of this class's Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

#### Level 10: Aura of Courage

You and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

#### Level 11: Radiant Strikes

Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

#### Level 14: Restoring Touch

When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### Level 18: Aura Expansion

Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Truesight is recommended.

### Paladin Spell List

This section presents the Paladin spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell's school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it's a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Paladin Subclass: Oath of Devotion

*Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order*

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals of justice and order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Let your word be your promise.
- Protect the weak and never fear to act.
- Let your honorable deeds be an example.

#### Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Table: Oath of Devotion Spells

| Paladin Level | Spells                                            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 3             | Protection from Evil and Good, Shield of Faith    |
| 5             | Aid, Zone of Truth                                |
| 9             | Beacon of Hope, Dispel Magic                      |
| 13            | Freedom of Movement, Guardian of Faith            |
| 17            | Commune, Flame Strike                             |

#### Level 3: Sacred Weapon

When you take the Attack action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one Melee weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.

The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.

You can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you aren't carrying the weapon.

#### Level 7: Aura of Devotion

You and your allies have Immunity to the Charmed condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

#### Level 15: Smite of Protection

Your magical smite now radiates protective energy. Whenever you cast *Divine Smite*, you and your allies have Half Cover while in your Aura of Protection. The aura has this benefit until the start of your next turn.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the Ranger spell list later in the class's description.

**Spell Slots.** The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+**. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells. *Cure Wounds* and *Ensnaring Strike* are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

#### Level 1: Favored Enemy

You always have the *Hunter's Mark* spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.

The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the Ranger Features table.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords.

#### Level 2: Deft Explorer

Thanks to your travels, you gain the following benefits.

**Expertise.** Choose one of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise. You gain Expertise in that skill.

**Languages.** You know two languages of your choice from the language tables in "Character Creation."

#### Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see "Feats"). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

**Druidic Warrior.** You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice (see the Druid class's section for a list of Druid spells). *Guidance* and *Starry Wisp* are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.

#### Level 3: Ranger Subclass

You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice. The Hunter subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Ranger level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Ranger levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Level 6: Roving

Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor. You also have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

#### Level 9: Expertise

Choose two of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise. You gain Expertise in those skills.

#### Level 10: Tireless

Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits.

**Temporary Hit Points.** As a Magic action, you can give yourself a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**Decrease Exhaustion.** Whenever you finish a Short Rest, your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1.

#### Level 13: Relentless Hunter

Taking damage can't break your Concentration on *Hunter's Mark*.

#### Level 14: Nature's Veil

You invoke spirits of nature to magically hide yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can give yourself the Invisible condition until the end of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 17: Precise Hunter

You have Advantage on attack rolls against the creature currently marked by your *Hunter's Mark*.

#### Level 18: Feral Senses

Your connection to the forces of nature grants you Blindsight with a range of 30 feet.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.

#### Level 20: Foe Slayer

The damage die of your *Hunter's Mark* is a d10 rather than a d6.

#### Level 1: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Sleight of Hand and Stealth are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

At Rogue level 6, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### Level 1: Sneak Attack

You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's type.

You don't need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't have the Incapacitated condition, and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll.

The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features table.

#### Level 1: Thieves' Cant

You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves' Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the language tables in "Character Creation."

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Daggers and Shortbows.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.

#### Level 2: Cunning Action

Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

#### Level 3: Rogue Subclass

You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. The Thief subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Rogue level or lower.

#### Level 3: Steady Aim

As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels 8, 10, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Cunning Strike

You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack's damage before rolling.

If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

**Poison (Cost: 1d6).** You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner's Kit on your person.

**Trip (Cost: 1d6).** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.

**Withdraw (Cost: 1d6).** Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

#### Level 5: Uncanny Dodge

When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack's damage against you (round down).

#### Level 7: Evasion

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you're subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can't use this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.

#### Level 7: Reliable Talent

Whenever you make an ability check that uses one of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

#### Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike

You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost for each effect.

#### Level 14: Devious Strikes

You've practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.

**Daze (Cost: 2d6).** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.

**Knock Out (Cost: 6d6).** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Obscure (Cost: 3d6).** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.

#### Level 15: Slippery Mind

Your cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.

#### Level 18: Elusive

You're so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have Advantage against you unless you have the Incapacitated condition.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the Night Spirit is recommended.

#### Level 20: Stroke of Luck

You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a D20 Test, you can turn the roll into a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

### Rogue Subclass: Thief

*Hunt for Treasure as a Classic Adventurer*

A mix of burglar, treasure hunter, and explorer, you are the epitome of an adventurer. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you gain abilities useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum benefit from the magic items you find there.

#### Level 3: Fast Hands

As a Bonus Action, you can do one of the following.

**Sleight of Hand.** Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with Thieves' Tools or to pick a pocket.

**Use an Object.** Take the Utilize action, or take the Magic action to use a magic item that requires that action.

#### Level 3: Second-Story Work

You've trained to get into especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits.

**Climber.** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.

**Jumper.** You can determine your jump distance using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.

#### Level 9: Supreme Sneak

You gain the following Cunning Strike option. *Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6).* If you have the Hide action's Invisible condition, this attack doesn't end that condition on you if you end the turn behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover.

#### Level 13: Use Magic Device

You've learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following benefits.

**Attunement.** You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

**Charges.** Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.

**Scrolls.** You can use any *Spell Scroll*, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

### Level 17: Thief's Reflexes

You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal Initiative and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. *Light*, *Prestidigitation*, *Shocking Grasp*, and *Sorcerous Burst* are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. *Burning Hands* and *Detect Magic* are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

#### Level 1: Innate Sorcery

An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:

- The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
- You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 2: Font of Magic

You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can't have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.

You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.

**Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points.** You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot's level (no action required).

**Creating Spell Slots.** As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.

Table: Creating Spell Slots

| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost | Min. Sorcerer Level |

#### Level 2: Metamagic

Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from "Metamagic Options" later in this class's description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don't know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

#### Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass

You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The Draconic Sorcery subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration

When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate

If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.

In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.

#### Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis

While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it.

### Metamagic Options

The following options are available to your Metamagic feature. The options are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Careful Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and

it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.

#### Distant Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell's range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the spell's range 30 feet.

#### Empowered Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you've already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

#### Extended Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

If the affected spell requires Concentration, you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration.

#### Heightened Spell

*Cost: 2 Sorcery Points*

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves against the spell.

#### Quickened Spell

*Cost: 2 Sorcery Points*

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting. You can't modify a spell in this way if you've already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way.

#### Seeking Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Spell even if you've already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

#### Subtle Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.

#### Transmuted Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder.

#### Twinned Spell

*Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*

When you cast a spell, such as *Charm Person*, that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the spell's effective level by 1.

### Sorcerer Spell List

This section presents the Sorcerer spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell's school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it's a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Sorcerer Subclass: Draconic Sorcery

*Breathe the Magic of Dragons*

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons' power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon's hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

#### Level 3: Draconic Resilience

The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

#### Level 3: Draconic Spells

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Table: Draconic Spells

| Sorcerer Level    | Spells                                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 3                 | Alter Self, Chromatic Orb, Command, Dragon's Breath    |
| 5                 | Fear, Fly                                              |
| 7                 | Arcane Eye, Charm Monster                              |
| 9                 | Legend Lore, Summon Dragon                             |

#### Level 6: Elemental Affinity

Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage type associated with dragons. Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.

You have Resistance to that damage type, and when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

#### Level 14: Dragon Wings

As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). For the duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### Level 18: Dragon Companion

You can cast *Summon Dragon* without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a Long Rest.

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require Concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.

#### Level 1: Eldritch Invocations

You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the "Eldritch Invocation Options" section later in this class's description.

**Prerequisites.** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.

**Replacing and Gaining Invocations.** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can't replace an invocation if it's a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.

When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.

You can't pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

#### Level 1: Pact Magic

Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. *Eldritch Blast* and *Prestidigitation* are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

For example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell *Charm Person*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. *Charm Person* and *Hex* are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.

If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

#### Level 2: Magical Cunning

You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 3: Warlock Subclass

You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Fiend Patron subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Warlock level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 9: Contact Patron

In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the *Contact Other Plane* spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell's saving throw.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 11: Mystic Arcanum

Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.

As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest.

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.

#### Level 20: Eldritch Master

When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

### Eldritch Invocation Options

Eldritch Invocation options appear in alphabetical order.

#### Agonizing Blast

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage*

Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage. You can add your Charisma modifier to that spell's damage rolls.

**Repeatable.** You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip.

#### Armor of Shadows

You can cast *Mage Armor* on yourself without expending a spell slot.

#### Ascendant Step

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*

You can cast *Levitate* on yourself without expending a spell slot.

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*

You can see normally in Dim Light and Darkness both magical and nonmagical—within 120 feet of yourself.

#### Devouring Blade

*Prerequisite: Level 12+ Warlock, Thirsting Blade Invocation*

The Extra Attack of your Thirsting Blade invocation confers two extra attacks rather than one.

#### Eldritch Mind

You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain Concentration.

#### Eldritch Smite

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation*

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to deal an extra 1d8 Force damage to the target, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot, and you can give the target the Prone condition if it is Huge or smaller.

#### Eldritch Spear

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage*

Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage and has a range of 10+ feet. When you cast that spell, its range increases by a number of feet equal to 30 times your Warlock level.

**Repeatable.** You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip.

#### Fiendish Vigor

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*

You can cast *False Life* on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don't roll the die for the Temporary Hit Points; you automatically get the highest number on the die.

#### Gaze of Two Minds

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*

You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can take a Bonus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. The connection ends if you don't maintain it in this way.

While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can cast spells as if you were in your space or the other creature's space if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other.

#### Gift of the Depths

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

You can also cast *Water Breathing* once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way again when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Gift of the Protectors

*Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Tome Invocation*

A new page appears in your *Book of Shadows* when you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can take an action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name).

When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 Hit Point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a Long Rest.

As a Magic action, you can erase a name on the page by touching it.

#### Investment of the Chain Master

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Chain Invocation*

When you cast *Find Familiar*, you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits.

**Aerial or Aquatic.** The familiar gains either a Fly Speed or a Swim Speed (your choice) of 40 feet.

**Quick Attack.** As a Bonus Action, you can command the familiar to take the Attack action.

**Necrotic or Radiant Damage.** Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead.

**Your Save DC.** If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.

**Resistance.** When the familiar takes damage, you can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against that damage.

#### **Lessons of the First Ones**

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*

You have received knowledge from an elder entity of the multiverse, allowing you to gain one Origin feat of your choice (see "Feats").

**Repeatable.** You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different Origin feat.

#### Lifedrinker

*Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation*

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice to roll it and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point).

#### Mask of Many Faces

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*

You can cast *Disguise Self* without expending a spell slot.

#### Master of Myriad Forms

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*

You can cast *Alter Self* without expending a spell slot.

#### Misty Visions

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*

You can cast *Silent Image* without expending a spell slot.

While you're in an area of Dim Light or Darkness, you can cast *Invisibility* on yourself without expending a spell slot.

#### Otherworldly Leap

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*

You can cast *Jump* on yourself without expending a spell slot.

#### Pact of the Blade

As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you bond—or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can't bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.

Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.

Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature's Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends.

#### Pact of the Chain

You learn the *Find Familiar* spell and can cast it as a Magic action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: **Imp, Pseudodragon, Quasit, Skeleton, Sphinx of Wonder, Sprite,** or **Venomous Snake** (see "Monsters" for the familiar's stat block).

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction.

#### Pact of the Tome

Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest. This *Book of Shadows* (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die.

**Cantrips and Rituals.** When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any class's spell list, and they must be spells you don't already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus.

#### Repelling Blast

*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage via an Attack Roll*

Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that requires an attack roll. When you hit a Large or smaller creature with that cantrip, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from you.

**Repeatable.** You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip.

#### Thirsting Blade

*Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation*

You gain the Extra Attack feature for your pact weapon only. With that feature, you can attack twice with the weapon instead of once when you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Visions of Distant Realms

You can cast *Arcane Eye* without expending a spell slot.

*Prerequisite: Level 7+ Warlock*

You can cast *Speak with Dead* without expending a spell slot.

#### Witch Sight

*Prerequisite: Level 15+ Warlock*

You have Truesight with a range of 30 feet.

### Warlock Spell List

This section presents the Warlock spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell's school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it's a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Warlock Subclass: Fiend Patron

*Make a Deal with the Lower Planes*

Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon lord, an archdevil, or another fiend that is especially mighty. That patron's aims are evil—the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you—and your path is defined by the extent to which you strive against those aims.

#### Level 3: Dark One's Blessing

When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Temporary Hit Point). You also gain this benefit if someone else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 Hit Points.

#### Level 3: Fiend Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Table: Fiend Spells

| Warlock Level | Spells                                            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 3             | Burning Hands, Command, Scorching Ray, Suggestion |
| 5             | Fireball, Stinking Cloud                          |
| 7             | Fire Shield, Wall of Fire                         |
| 9             | Geas, Insect Plague                               |

#### Level 6: Dark One's Own Luck

You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 10: Fiendish Resilience

Choose one damage type, other than Force, whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest. You have Resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.

#### Level 14: Hurl Through Hell

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 Psychic damage if it isn't a Fiend, and it has the Incapacitated condition until the end of your next turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. *Light*, *Mage Hand*, and *Ray of Frost* are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.

**Spellbook.** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting *Identify*. You determine the book's appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.

The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. *Detect Magic*, *Feather Fall*, *Mage Armor*, *Magic Missile*, *Sleep*, and *Thunderwave* are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.

**Spell Slots.** The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

#### Level 1: Ritual Adept

You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn't have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.

#### Level 1: Arcane Recovery

You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you're a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels' worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 2: Scholar

While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill.

#### Level 3: Wizard Subclass

You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The Evoker subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Wizard level or lower.

> ### Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook
> 
> The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a *Spell Scroll*, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.
>
> **Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it's of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.
> 
> **Copying the Book.** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.
>
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Memorize Spell

Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.

#### Level 18: Spell Mastery

You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.

#### Level 20: Signature Spells

Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

#### Wizard Spell List

This section presents the Wizard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell's school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it's a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Wizard Subclass: Evoker

*Create Explosive Elemental Effects*

Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect others, while some seek their own gain.

#### Level 3: Evocation Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Level 3: Potent Cantrip

Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

#### Level 6: Sculpt Spells

You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

#### Level 10: Empowered Evocation

Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation school, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

#### Level 14: Overchannel

You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.

Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.

## Character Species

When you choose your character's species, you determine whether your character is a human or a member of a fantastical species, such as dragonborn or gnome.

The peoples of the multiverse hail from different worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms. A player character's species is the set of game traits that an adventurer gains from being one of those life forms.

Some species can trace their origin to a single world, plane of existence, or god, while other species first appeared in multiple realms at once. Whatever a species' genesis, its members have spread across the multiverse and contribute to many different cultures.

Members of most species live for about 80 years, with exceptions noted in the text about the species in "Character Origins." Regardless of life span, members of all species reach physical maturity at about the same age. Your character can be any age that isn't beyond their species' normal life span.

### Parts of a Species

A species includes the following parts.

#### Creature Type

A character's species determines the character's creature type, which is described in "Rules Glossary." Every species in "Character Origins" is Humanoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in other books.

#### Size

Your character's species determines the character's size. Individuals within a species cover a wide range of heights, and some species include such diversity of size that you can choose whether your character is Small or Medium.

#### **Speed**

Your character's species determines the character's Speed.

#### **Special Traits**

Each species gives a character special traits unique characteristics based on the species' physiology or magical nature. When you choose a species, your character gets all the special traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a choice from a handful of options.

### Species Descriptions

#### Dragonborn

**Creature Type:** Humanoid 

**Size:** Medium (about 5–7 feet tall) 

**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Dragonborn, you have these special traits.

**Draconic Ancestry.** Your lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind of dragon from the Draconic Ancestors table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage Resistance traits as well as your appearance.

Table: Draconic Ancestors

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Lightning   | 
| Brass  | Fire        |

**Breath Weapon.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10).

During that time, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Table: Elven Lineages

| Lineage  | Level 1                                                                                                   | Level 3      | Level 5            |

For example, if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both.

# Equipment

## Coins

Characters often find coins on their adventures and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other businesses. Coins come in different denominations based on the relative worth of their material. The Coin Values table lists coins and how much they're worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game's main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are worth 1 Gold Piece.

A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

Table: Coin Values

| Coin                | Value in GP |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Copper Piece (CP)   | 1/100       |
| Silver Piece (SP)   | 1/10        |
| Electrum Piece (EP) | 1/2         |
| Gold Piece (GP)     | 1           |
| Platinum Piece (PP) | 10          |

## Weapons

The Weapons table in this section shows the game's main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

- **Category.** Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
- **Melee or Ranged.** A weapon is classified as either Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
- **Damage.** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.
- **Properties.** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the "Properties" section.
- **Mastery.** Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the "Mastery Properties" section. To use that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

> ### Selling Equipment
> 
> Equipment fetches half its cost when sold. In contrast, trade goods and valuables—like gems and art objects—retain their full value in the marketplace. "Magic Items" has prices for magic items.

### Weapon Proficiency

Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to an attack roll you make with it. A player character's features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.

### Properties

Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.

#### Ammunition

You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

#### Finesse

When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Heavy

You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

#### Light

When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

#### Loading

You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### Range

A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the long range.

#### Reach

A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

#### Thrown

If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

#### Two-Handed

A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

#### Versatile

A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Mastery Properties

Each weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below.

> ### Improvised Weapons
>
> If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see "Improvised Weapons" in "Rules Glossary." Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.

#### Cleave

If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Graze

If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

#### Nick

When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Push

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.

#### Sap

If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

#### Slow

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

#### Topple

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

#### Vex

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

## Armor

The Armor table lists the game's main armor. The table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well as the following details:

- **Category.** Every type of armor falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as shown in the table).
- **Armor Class (AC).** The table's Armor Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.
- **Strength.** If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armor type, that armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.
- **Stealth.** If the table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

### Armor Training

Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as explained below. A character's class and other features determine the character's armor training. A monster has training with any armor in its stat block.

#### Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor

If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

#### Shield

You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.

### One at a Time

A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time and wield only one Shield at a time.

| Airship      | 8 mph  | 10   | 20         | 1            | 13 | 300 | —                | 40,000 GP |
| Galley       | 4 mph  | 80   | —          | 150          | 15 | 500 | 20               | 30,000 GP |
| Keelboat     | 1 mph  | 1    | 6          | 1/2          | 15 | 100 | 10               | 3,000 GP  |
| Longship     | 3 mph  | 40   | 150        | 10           | 15 | 300 | 15               | 10,000 GP |
| Rowboat      | 1½ mph | 1    | 3          | —            | 11 | 50  | —                | 50 GP     |
| Sailing Ship | 2 mph  | 20   | 20         | 100          | 15 | 300 | 15               | 10,000 GP |
| Warship      | 2½ mph | 60   | 60         | 200          | 15 | 500 | 20               | 25,000 GP |

#### Crew

A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled hirelings (see "Hirelings" later in "Equipment") to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship, as shown in the table.

#### Passengers

The table lists the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.

#### Damage Threshold

If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see "Rules Glossary"), it's noted in the table.

#### Ship Repair

Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.

## Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities.

At the start of each week or month (GM's choice), choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor, Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.

Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the GM might take them into account when determining risks or how others perceive your character.

### Wretched (Free)

You survive via chance and charity. You're often exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping outside.

### Squalid (1 SP per Day)

You spend the bare minimum for your necessities. You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and opportunistic criminals.

### Poor (2 SP per Day)

You spend frugally for your necessities.

### Modest (1 GP per Day)

You support yourself at an average level.

### Comfortable (2 GP per Day)

You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a few luxuries.

### Wealthy (4 GP per Day)

You're accustomed to the finer things in life and might have servants.

### Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)

You pay for the best and might have a staff that supports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and might encourage you to share it, either legally or otherwise.

### Food, Drink, and Lodging

The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for food and a single night's lodging. Prices for daily lodging and meals are included in your lifestyle's expenses.

Table: Food, Drink

| Item                   | Cost  |
|------------------------|-------|
| Ale (mug)              | 4 CP  |
| Bread (loaf)           | 2 CP  |
| Cheese (wedge)         | 1 SP  |
| Meal - Squalid         | 1 CP  |
| Meal - Poor            | 2 CP  |
| Meal - Modest          | 1 SP  |
| Meal - Comfortable     | 2 SP  |
| Meal - Wealthy         | 3 SP  |
| Meal - Aristocratic    | 6 SP  |
| Wine (bottle) - Common | 2 SP  |
| Wine (bottle) - Fine   | 10 GP |

Table: Inn Stay per Day

| Item             | Cost |
|------------------|------|
| Squalid          | 7 CP |
| Poor             | 1 SP |
| Modest           | 5 SP |
| Comfortable      | 8 SP |
| Wealthy          | 2 GP |
| Aristocratic     | 4 GP |

## **Hirelings**

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, an artisan, a scribe, or the like. The pay shown on the Hirelings table is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for work that requires no particular proficiencies; they include laborers and porters.

Table: Hirelings

| Service            | Cost          |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Skilled hireling   | 2 GP per day  |
| Untrained hireling | 2 SP per day  |
| Messenger          | 2 CP per mile |

## Spellcasting

Most settlements contain individuals who are willing to cast spells in exchange for payment. If a spell has expensive components, add the cost of those components to the cost listed in the Spellcasting Services table. The higher the level of a desired spell, the harder it is to find someone to cast it.

Table: Spellcasting Services

| Spell Level | Availability           | Cost       |
|-------------|------------------------|------------|
| Cantrip     | Village, town, or city | 30 GP      |
| 1           | Village, town, or city | 50 GP      |
| 2           | Village, town, or city | 200 GP     |
| 3           | Town or city only      | 300 GP     |
| 4–5         | Town or city only      | 2,000 GP   |
| 6–8         | City only              | 20,000 GP  |
| 9           | City only              | 100,000 GP |

## Magic Items

Adventures hold the promise—but not a guarantee—of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic items are detailed in "Magic Items" later in this document. Here's what you need to know about using magic items.

### Identifying a Magic Item

Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspicuously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learning a magic item's properties isn't automatic.

The *Identify* spell is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties. Alternatively, you can focus on one magic item during a Short Rest while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, you learn its properties and how to use them (but not any curse the item might bear).

Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched inside the band, or a feathered design might hint that it's a *Ring of Feather Falling*.

Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. In the specific case of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster what a potion does. Other items might require more experimentation. For example, if your character puts on a *Ring of Swimming*, the GM might say, "Your movement feels strangely fluid." Perhaps you then dive into a river to see what happens. The GM would then say you swim unexpectedly well.

### Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond—called Attunement—with them before the creature can use an item's magical properties. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires Attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren't attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.

#### Attune during a Short Rest

Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short Rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same Short Rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the Short Rest, you're attuned to the magic item and can access its full magical capabilities.

#### No More Than Three Items

You can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item first. Additionally, you can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, you can't attune to more than one *Ring of Protection* at a time.

#### Ending Attunement

Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to

the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement by spending another Short Rest focused on the item unless the item is cursed.

### Wearing and Wielding Items

Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head, and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned, a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.

In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

#### Multiple Items of the Same Kind

You can't wear more than one of certain magic items. You can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions.

#### Paired Items

Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a *Boot of Striding and Springing* on one foot and a *Boot of Elvenkind* on the other foot gains no benefit from either.

## Crafting Nonmagical Items

To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw materials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If you meet the requirements, you make the item, and you can use it or sell it at its normal price.

### Tools

The "Tools" section of "Equipment" lists which tools are required to make certain items. The GM assigns required tools for items not listed there.

You must use the required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who helps you must also have proficiency with it.

### Raw Materials

To make an item, you need raw materials worth half its purchase cost (round down). For example, you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available.

### Time

To determine how many days (working 8 hours a day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Crossbow, which sells for 50 GP.

If an item requires multiple days, the days needn't be consecutive.

Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.

## Brewing Potions of Healing

A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism Kit can create a *Potion of Healing*. Doing so requires using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the course of 1 day (8 hours of work).

## **Scribing Spell Scrolls**

A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create a *Spell Scroll*, using the rules below.

### Time and Cost

Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple days, those days needn't be consecutive.

### Prerequisites for the Scribe

To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill or with Calligrapher's Supplies and have the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed only when you complete the scroll. The scroll's spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.

## **Cantrips**

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were your level.

Table: Spell Scroll Costs

| Spell Level | Time     | Cost      |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Cantrip     | 1 day    | 15 GP     |
| 1           | 1 day    | 25 GP     |
| 2           | 3 days   | 100 GP    |
| 3           | 5 days   | 150 GP    |
| 4           | 10 days  | 1,000 GP  |
| 5           | 25 days  | 1,500 GP  |
| 6           | 40 days  | 10,000 GP |
| 7           | 50 days  | 12,500 GP |
| 8           | 60 days  | 15,000 GP |
| 9           | 120 days | 50,000 GP |

# Spells

## Gaining Spells

Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell prepared in your mind or have access to the spell from a magic item, such as a *Spell Scroll*. Your features specify which spells you have access to, if any; whether you always have certain spells prepared; and whether you can change the list of spells you have prepared.

### Preparing Spells

If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your spellcasting feature specifies when you can change the list and the number of spells you can change, as summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.

Table: Spell Preparation by Class

| Class    | Change When You …    | Number of Spells |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| Bard     | Gain a level         | One              |
| Cleric   | Finish a Long Rest   | Any              |
| Druid    | Finish a Long Rest   | Any              |
| Paladin  | Finish a Long Rest   | One              |
| Ranger   | Finish a Long Rest   | One              |
| Sorcerer | Gain a level         | One              |
| Warlock  | Gain a level         | One              |
| Wizard   | Finish a Long Rest   | Any              |

Most spellcasting monsters don't change their lists of prepared spells, but the GM is free to alter them.

### Always-Prepared Spells

Certain features might give you a spell that you always have prepared. If you also have a list of prepared spells that you can change, a spell that you always have prepared doesn't count against the number of spells on that list.

## Casting Spells

Each spell description has a series of entries that provide the details needed to cast the spell. The following sections explain each of those entries, which follow a spell's name.

> ### Casting in Armor
>
> You must have training with any armor you are wearing to cast spells while wearing it. You are otherwise too hampered by the armor for spellcasting.

### Spell Level

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indicated in a spell's description. A spell's level is an indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips—simple spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels.

#### Spell Slots

Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster's magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.

When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot with the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that's at least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts *Magic Missile*, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining.

Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell slots.

#### Casting without Slots

There are several ways to cast a spell without expending a spell slot:

**Cantrips.** A cantrip is cast without a spell slot. 

**Rituals**. Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn't expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.

**Special Abilities.** Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.

**Magic Items.** *Spell Scrolls* and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.

#### Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts *Magic Missile* using a level 2 slot, that *Magic Missile* is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as *Magic Missile* and *Cure Wounds*, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.

### **School of Magic**

Each spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These categories help describe spells but have no rules of their own, although some other rules refer to them.

Table: Schools of Magic

| School        | Typical Effects                                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Abjuration    | Prevents or reverses harmful effects                         |
| Conjuration   | Transports creatures or objects                              |
| Divination    | Reveals information                                          |
| Enchantment   | Influences minds                                             |
| Evocation     | Channels energy to create effects that are often destructive |
| Illusion      | Deceives the mind or senses                                  |
| Necromancy    | Manipulates life and death                                   |
| Transmutation | Transforms creatures or objects                              |

### Class Spell Lists

If a spell is on a class's spell list, the class's name appears in parentheses after the spell's school of magic. Some features add a spell to a character's spell list even if the character isn't a member of a class in the parentheses.

### Casting Time

Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 1 minute or more. A spell's Casting Time entry specifies which of those is required.

#### One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn

On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast a spell. This rule means you can't, for example, cast a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn.

#### Reaction and Bonus Action Triggers

A spell that has a casting time of a Reaction is cast in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell's Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a trigger defined in the spell.

#### Longer Casting Times

Certain spells—including a spell cast as a Ritual—require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 minute or more, you must take the Magic action on each of your turns, and you must maintain Concentration (see "Rules Glossary") while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again, you must start over.

### Range

A spell's range indicates how far from the spellcaster the spell's effect can originate, and the spell's description specifies which part of the effect is limited by the range.

A range usually takes one of the following forms:

**Distance.** The range is expressed in feet.

**Touch**. The spell's effect originates on something, as defined by the spell, that the spellcaster must touch within their reach.

**Self.** The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates from them, as specified in the spell.

If a spell has movable effects, they aren't restricted by its range unless the spell's description says otherwise.

### Components

A spell's components are physical requirements the spellcaster must meet to cast the spell. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires Verbal (V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. If the spellcaster can't provide one or more of a spell's components, the spellcaster can't cast the spell.

#### Verbal (V)

A Verbal component is the chanting of esoteric words that sound like nonsense to the uninitiated. The words must be uttered in a normal speaking voice. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is gagged or in an area of magical silence can't cast a spell with a Verbal component.

#### Somatic (S)

A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must use at least one of their hands to perform these movements.

#### Material (M)

A Material component is a particular material used in a spell's casting, as specified in parentheses in the Components entry. These materials aren't consumed by the spell unless the spell's description states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand free to access them, but it can be the same hand used to perform Somatic components, if any.

If a spell doesn't consume its materials and doesn't specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use a Component Pouch (see "Equipment") instead of providing the materials specified in the spell, or the spellcaster can substitute a Spellcasting Focus if the caster has a feature that allows that substitution. To use a Component Pouch, you must have a hand free to reach into it, and to use a Spellcasting Focus, you must hold it unless its description says otherwise (see "Equipment" for descriptions).

### Duration

A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of the following forms:

**Concentration.** A duration that requires Concentration follows the Concentration rules (see "Rules Glossary").

**Instantaneous.** An instantaneous duration means the spell's magic appears only for a moment and then disappears.

**Time Span.** A duration that provides a time span specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, minutes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration entry might say "1 minute," meaning the spell ends after 1 minute has passed. While a time-span spell that you cast is ongoing, you can dismiss it (no action required) if you don't have the Incapacitated condition.

### Effects

The effects of a spell are detailed after its duration entry. Those details present exactly what the spell does, which ignores mundane physical laws; any outcomes beyond those effects are under the GM's purview. Whatever the effects, they typically deal with targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all three, each of which is detailed below.

#### Targets

A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description says whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or something else.

**_A Clear Path to the Target._** To target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind Total Cover.

**_Targeting Yourself._** If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature other than you.

**_Areas of Effect._** Some spells, such as *Thunderwave*, cover an area called an area of effect, which is defined in "Rules Glossary." The area determines what the spell targets. The description of a spell specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Emanation, Line, or Sphere.

**_Awareness of Being Targeted._** Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature doesn't know it was targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell's description says otherwise.

**_Invalid Targets._** If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't be affected by it, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended.

If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.

#### Saving Throws

Many spells specify that a target makes a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. Here's how to calculate the DC for your spells:

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus

#### Attack Rolls

Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell hits a target. Here's how to calculate the attack modifier for your spells:

**Spell attack modifier** = your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus

#### Combining Spell Effects

The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast *Bless* on the same target, that target gains the spell's benefit only once; the target doesn't receive two bonus dice. But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect continues until the duration of the second *Bless* ends.

> ### Identifying an Ongoing Spell
>
> You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To identify it, you must take the Study action and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

## Spell Descriptions

### A Spells

#### Acid Arrow

*Level 2 Evocation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 90 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 2.

#### Acid Splash

*Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create an acidic bubble at a point within range, where it explodes in a 5-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that Sphere must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 Acid damage.

**_Cantrip Upgrade._** The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).

#### **Aid**

*Level 2 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)* 

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a strip of white cloth) 

**Duration:** 8 hours

Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's Hit Point maximum and current Hit Points increase by 5 for the duration.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** Each target's Hit Points increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 2.

#### Alarm

*Level 1 Abjuration (Ranger, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:

**Audible Alarm.** The alarm produces the sound of a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the warded area.

**Mental Alarm.** You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you're asleep.

#### **Alter Self**

*Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration, during which you can take a Magic action to replace the option you chose with a different one.

**_Aquatic Adaptation._** You sprout gills and grow webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

**_Change Appearance._** You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can take a Magic action to change your appearance in this way again.

**_Natural Weapons._** You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with that new growth, it deals 1d6 damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength.

#### Animal Friendship

*Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food) 

**Duration:** 24 hours

Target a Beast that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. If you or one of your allies deals damage to the target, the spells ends.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You can target one additional Beast for each spell slot level above 1.

#### Animal Messenger

*Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food) 

**Duration:** 24 hours

A Tiny Beast of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it attempts to deliver a message for you (if the target's Challenge Rating isn't 0, it automatically succeeds). You specify a location you have visited and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a person dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat." You also communicate a message of up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels for the duration toward the specified location, covering about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast can fly.

When the Beast arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, mimicking your communication. If the Beast doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the Beast returns to where you cast the spell.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The spell's duration increases by 48 hours for each spell slot level above 2.

#### Animal Shapes

*Level 8 Transmutation (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 24 hours

Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. Each target shape-shifts into a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that has a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a different form for each target. On later turns, you can take a Magic action to transform the targets again.

A target's game statistics are replaced by the chosen Beast's statistics, but the target retains its creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; alignment; ability to communicate; and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target's actions are limited by the Beast form's anatomy, and it can't cast spells. The target's equipment melds into the new form, and the target can't use any of that equipment while in that form.

The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the first form into which it shape-shifts. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The transformation lasts for the duration or until the target ends it as a Bonus Action.

#### Animate Dead

*Level 3 Necromancy (Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute 

**Range:** 10 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes an Undead creature: a **Skeleton** if you chose bones or a **Zombie** if you chose a corpse (see "Monsters" for the stat blocks).

On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating a new creature.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You animate or reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each spell slot level above 3. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

#### Animate Objects

*Level 5 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Objects animate at your command. Choose a number of nonmagical objects within range that aren't being worn or carried, aren't fixed to a surface, and aren't Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; for this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as one object, a Large target counts as two, and a Huge target counts as three.

Each target animates, sprouts legs, and becomes a Construct that uses the **Animated Object** stat block; this creature is under your control until the spell ends or until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each creature you make with this spell is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count and takes its turn immediately after yours.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. When the creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it reverts to its object form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The creature's Slam damage increases by 1d4 (Medium or smaller), 1d6 (Large), or 1d12 (Huge) for each spell slot level above 5.

> #### Animated Object

#### Antilife Shell

*Level 5 Abjuration (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

An aura extends from you in a 10-foot Emanation for the duration. The aura prevents creatures other than Constructs and Undead from passing or reaching through it. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with Ranged or Reach weapons through the barrier.

If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.

#### Antimagic Field

*Level 8 Abjuration (Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (iron filings) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

An aura of antimagic surrounds you in 10-foot Emanation. No one can cast spells, take Magic actions, or create other magical effects inside the aura, and those things can't target or otherwise affect anything inside it. Magical properties of magic items don't work inside the aura or on anything inside it.

Areas of effect created by spells or other magic can't extend into the aura, and no one can teleport into or out of it or use planar travel there. Portals close temporarily while in the aura.

Ongoing spells, except those cast by an Artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the area. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

*Dispel Magic* has no effect on the aura, and the auras created by different *Antimagic Field* spells don't nullify each other.

#### Antipathy/Sympathy

*Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a mix of vinegar and honey) 

**Duration:** 10 days

As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save:

**Antipathy.** The creature has the Frightened condition. The Frightened creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target, moving by the safest route.

**Sympathy.** The creature has the Charmed condition. The Charmed creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by the safest route. If the creature is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can't willingly move away. If the target damages the Charmed creature, that creature can make a

Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

**_Ending the Effect._** If the Frightened or Charmed creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.

#### **Arcane Eye**

*Level 4 Divination (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an Invisible, invulnerable eye within range that hovers for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can see in every direction. It also has Darkvision with a range of 30 feet.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

#### Arcane Hand

*Level 5 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (an eggshell and a glove) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a Large hand of shimmering magical energy in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and Hit Points equal to your Hit Point maximum. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends. The hand doesn't occupy its space.

When you cast the spell and as a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects:

**Clenched Fist.** The hand strikes a target within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 Force damage.

**Forceful Hand.** The hand attempts to push a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target, remaining within 5 feet of it.

**Grasping Hand.** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or the target has the Grappled condition, with an escape DC equal to your spell save DC. While the hand grapples the target, you can take a Bonus Action to cause the hand to crush it, dealing Bludgeoning damage to the target equal to 4d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Interposing Hand.** The hand grants you Half Cover against attacks and other effects that originate from its space or that pass through it. In addition, its space counts as Difficult Terrain for your enemies.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage of the Clenched Fist increases by 2d8 and the damage of the Grasping Hand increases by 2d6 for each spell slot level above 5.

#### Arcane Lock

*Level 2 Abjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, container, or hatch and magically lock it for the duration. This lock can't be unlocked by any nonmagical means. You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open and close the object despite the lock. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, unlocks it for 1 minute.

#### Arcane Sword

*Level 7 Evocation (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 90 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature sword worth 250+ GP)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a spectral sword that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

On your later turns, you can take a Bonus Action to move the sword up to 30 feet to a spot you can see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different one.

#### Arcanist's Magic Aura

*Level 2 Illusion (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)

**Duration:** 24 hours

With a touch, you place an illusion on a willing creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried. A creature gains the Mask effect below, and an object gains the False Aura effect below. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast the spell on the same target every day for 30 days, the illusion lasts until dispelled.

**_Mask (Creature)._** Choose a creature type other than the target's actual type. Spells and other magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of the chosen type.

**_False Aura (Object)._** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect magical auras, such as *Detect Magic*. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, make a magic item appear nonmagical, or change the object's aura so that it appears to belong to a school of magic you choose.

#### Astral Projection

*Level 9 Necromancy (Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (for each of the spell's targets, one jacinth worth 1,000+ GP and one silver bar worth 100+ GP, all of which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane). Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn't need food or air, and doesn't age.

A target's astral form resembles its body in almost every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only when an effect states that it does so—the target's body and astral form both die.

A target's astral form can travel through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the target's body and possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter its body on the new plane.

Any damage or other effects that apply to an astral form have no effect on the target's body and vice versa. If a target's body or astral form drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to dismiss it.

When the spell ends for a target who isn't dead, the target reappears in its body and exits the state of suspended animation.

#### Augury

*Level 2 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual 

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, cards, or other divinatory tokens worth 25+ GP) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses the omen from the Omens table.

Table: Omens

| Omen         | For Results That Will Be … |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| Weal         | Good                       |
| Woe          | Bad                        |
| Weal and woe | Good and bad               |
| Indifference | Neither good nor bad       |

The spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

#### Aura of Life

*Level 4 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)* 

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have Resistance to Necrotic damage, and your Hit Point maximums can't be reduced. If an ally with 0 Hit Points starts its turn in the aura, that ally regains 1 Hit Point.

#### Awaken

*Level 5 Transmutation (Bard, Druid)*

**Casting Time:** 8 hours

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You spend the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, and then touch the target. The target must be either a Beast or Plant creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that isn't a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a Plant creature and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. The GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the **Awakened Shrub** or **Awakened Tree** in "Monsters."

The awakened target has the Charmed condition for 30 days or until you or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature chooses its attitude toward you.

### B Spells

#### Bane

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must each make a Charisma saving throw. Whenever a target that fails this save makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must subtract 1d4 from the attack roll or save.

#### Banishment

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (GM's choice) associated with its creature type.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

#### Barkskin

*Level 2 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger)*

You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes 10d12 Psychic damage and can't cast spells or take the Magic action. At the end of every 30 days, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by the *Greater Restoration*, *Heal*, or *Wish* spell.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

#### Bestow Curse

**Casting Time:** Action

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

- Choose one ability. The target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.
- The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn.
- If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain Concentration on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require Concentration, and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5–6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7–8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled.

#### Black Tentacles

*Level 4 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 90 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a tentacle) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into Difficult Terrain.

Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage, and it has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.

A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.

#### Blade Barrier

*Level 6 Evocation (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 90 feet

The wall provides Three-Quarters Cover, and its space is Difficult Terrain.

Any creature in the wall's space makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes that save if it enters the wall's space or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.

#### Blight

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save.

Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It doesn't make a save; it simply withers and dies.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.

#### Blindness/Deafness

*Level 2 Transmutation (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

*Level 3 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

Roll 1d6 at the end of each of your turns for the duration. On a roll of 4–6, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane). While on the Ethereal Plane, you can

perceive the plane you left, which is cast in shades of gray, but you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can affect and be affected only by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane, and creatures on the other plane can't perceive you unless they have a special ability that lets them perceive things on the Ethereal Plane.

You return to the other plane at the start of your next turn and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane. You return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you left. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space.

#### Blur

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self

An inert duplicate of that creature forms inside the vessel used in the spell's casting and finishes growing after 120 days; you choose whether the finished clone is the same age as the creature or younger.

If the original creature dies after the clone finishes forming, the creature's soul transfers to the clone if the soul is free and willing to return.

**Duration:** 1 minute

You contact a deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

#### Commune with Nature

*Level 5 Divination (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition until the spell ends.

For the duration, you can take a Bonus Action to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each Charmed target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn, taking the safest route. After moving in this way, a target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

| 2–6  | The target doesn't move or take actions.                                                                                                     |

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a longdead sage, or some other knowledgeable entity from another plane. Contacting this otherworldly intelligence can break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

On a failed save, you take 6d6 Psychic damage and have the Incapacitated condition until you finish a Long Rest. A *Greater Restoration* spell cast on you ends this effect.

#### Contagion

#### Contingency

*Level 6 Abjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem-encrusted statuette of yourself worth 1,500+ GP) 

**Duration:** 10 days

Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting *Contingency*, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a *Contingency* cast with *Water Breathing* might stipulate that *Water Breathing* comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then *Contingency* ends.

The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one *Contingency* spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another *Contingency* spell on you ends. Also, *Contingency* ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

#### Continual Flame

*Level 2 Evocation (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

A flame springs from an object that you touch. The effect casts Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. It looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and consumes no fuel. The flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.

#### Control Water

*Level 4 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 300 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a mixture of water and dust) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, you control any water inside an area you choose that is a Cube up to 100 feet on a side, using one of the following effects. As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

**_Flood._** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

**_Part Water._** You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

**_Redirect Flow._** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

**_Whirlpool._** You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull away and succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.

#### Control Weather

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense)

When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new

conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.

#### Counterspell

*Level 3 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of yourself casting a spell with Verbal, Somatic, or Material components 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, Bonus Action, or Reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn't expended.

#### Create Food and Water

*Level 3 Conjuration (Cleric, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of fresh water on the ground or in containers within range—both useful in fending off the hazards of malnutrition and dehydration. The food is bland but nourishing and looks like a food of your choice, and the water is clean. The food spoils after 24 hours if uneaten.

#### Create or Destroy Water

*Level 1 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a mix of water and sand) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You do one of the following:

**Create Water.** You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot Cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames there.

**Destroy Water.** You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot Cube within range.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the Cube increases by 5 feet, for each spell slot level above 1.

#### Create Undead

*Level 6 Necromancy (Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute 

**Range:** 10 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (one 150+ GP black onyx stone for each corpse) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids within range. Each one becomes a **Ghoul** under your control (see "Monsters" for its stat block).

As a Bonus Action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to them). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular place. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow the order until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating new ones.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** If you use a level 7 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four **Ghouls**. If you use a level 8 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five **Ghouls** or two **Ghasts** or **Wights**. If you use a level 9 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six **Ghouls**, three **Ghasts** or **Wights**, or two **Mummies**. See "Monsters" for these stat blocks.

#### Creation

*Level 5 Illusion (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a paintbrush) 

**Duration:** Special

You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create an object within range. It is either an object of vegetable matter (soft goods, rope, wood, and the like) or mineral matter (stone, crystal, metal, and the like). The object must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen.

The spell's duration depends on the object's material, as shown in the Materials table. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. Using any object created by this spell as another spell's Material component causes the other spell to fail.

Table: Materials

| Material              | Duration   |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Vegetable matter      | 24 hours   |
| Stone or crystal      | 12 hours   |

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create up to four torch-size lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover for the duration. Alternatively, you combine the four lights into one glowing Medium form that is vaguely humanlike. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds Dim Light in a 10 foot radius.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a space within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light vanishes if it exceeds the spell's range.

#### Darkness

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, magical Darkness spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. Darkvision can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the Darkness to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the Darkness.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of Bright Light or Dim Light created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

#### Darkvision

*Level 2 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of Darkness created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

#### Death Ward

*Level 4 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death. The first time the target would drop to 0 Hit Points before the spell ends, the target instead drops to 1 Hit Point, and the spell ends.

If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantly without dealing damage, that effect is negated against the target, and the spell ends.

#### Delayed Blast Fireball

*Level 7 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 150 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of yellow light flashes from you, then condenses at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, the bead explodes, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes Fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell's base damage is 12d6, and the damage increases by 1d6 whenever your turn ends and the spell hasn't ended.

If a creature touches the glowing bead before the spell ends, that creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends, causing the bead to explode. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. If the thrown bead enters a creature's space or collides with a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.

When the bead explodes, flammable objects in the explosion that aren't being worn or carried start burning.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The base damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 7.

#### Demiplane

*Level 8 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** S 

**Duration:** 1 hour

You create a shadowy Medium door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. This door can be opened and closed, and it leads to a demiplane that is an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone (your choice).

When the spell ends, the door vanishes, and any objects inside the demiplane remain there. Any creatures inside also remain unless they opt to be shunted through the door as it vanishes, landing with the Prone condition in the unoccupied spaces closest to the door's former space.

Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane or connect the shadowy door to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can connect the shadowy door to that demiplane instead.

#### Detect Evil and Good

**Casting Time:** Action

For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within 30 feet of yourself. If you sense such effects, you can take the Magic action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears the magic, and if an effect was created by a spell, you learn the spell's school of magic.

The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.

#### Detect Poison and Disease

*Level 1 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (1 Copper Piece) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You activate one of the effects below. Until the spell ends, you can activate either effect as a Magic action on your later turns.

**_Sense Thoughts._** You sense the presence of thoughts within 30 feet of yourself that belong to creatures that know languages or are telepathic. You don't read the thoughts, but you know that a thinking creature is present.

The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.

**_Read Thoughts._** Target one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself or one creature within 30 feet of yourself that you detected with the Sense Thoughts option. You learn what is most on the target's mind right now. If the target doesn't know any languages and isn't telepathic, you learn nothing.

As a Magic action on your next turn, you can try to probe deeper into the target's mind. If you probe deeper, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you discern the target's reasoning, emotions, and something that looms large in its mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful save, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and until you shift your attention away from the target's mind, the target can take an action on its turn to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC, ending the spell on a success.

#### Dimension Door

*Level 4 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 500 feet 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You teleport to a location within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "300 feet upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle."

You can also teleport one willing creature. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you teleport, and it teleports to a space within 5 feet of your destination space.

If you, the other creature, or both would arrive in a space occupied by a creature or completely filled by one or more objects, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 Force damage, and the teleportation fails.

#### Disguise Self

*Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 1 hour

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the Study action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

#### Disintegrate

*Level 6 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and dust) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by *Wall of Force.*

A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 Hit Points, it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a *True Resurrection* or a *Wish* spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-Cube portion of it.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 3d6 for each spell slot level above 6.

*Break Enchantment.* As a Magic action, you touch a creature that is possessed by or has the Charmed or Frightened condition from one or more creatures of the types above. The target is no longer possessed, Charmed, or Frightened by such creatures.

*Dismissal.* As a Magic action, you target one creature you can see within 5 feet of you that has one of the creature types above. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane if it isn't there already. If they aren't on their home plane, Undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and Fey are sent to the Feywild.

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any ongoing spell of level 3 or lower on the target ends.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You automatically end a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you use.

*Level 1 Enchantment (Bard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant melody in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Psychic damage and must immediately use its Reaction, if available, to move as far away from you as it can, using the safest route. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.

#### Divination

*Level 4 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual 

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell puts you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask one question about a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply, which might be a short phrase or cryptic rhyme. The spell doesn't account for circumstances that might change the answer, such as the casting of other spells.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

You utter a word imbued with power from the Upper Planes. Each creature of your choice in range makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target that has 50 Hit Points or fewer suffers an effect based on its current Hit Points, as shown in the Divine Word Effects table. Regardless of its Hit Points, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend target that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn't there already) and can't return to the current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a *Wish* spell.

Table: Divine Word Effects

| Hit Points | Effect                                                                   |

You have a telepathic link with the Charmed target while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. On your turn, you can use this link to issue commands to the target (no action required), such as "Attack that creature," "Move over there," or "Fetch that object." The target does its best to obey on its turn. If it completes an order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it acts and moves as it likes, focusing on protecting itself.

You can command the target to take a Reaction but must take your own Reaction to do so.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** Your Concentration can last longer with a spell slot of level 5 (up to 10 minutes), 6 (up to 1 hour), or 7+ (up to 8 hours).

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the spell's duration. The messenger can also shape the dream's environment, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the spell. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking.

If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to sleep, at which point the messenger enters its dreams.

You can make the messenger terrifying to the target. If you do so, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words, and then the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and it takes 3d6 Psychic damage when it wakes up.

If the target is an unwilling creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect.

Everything that a targeted creature is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item it drops returns to normal size at once. A thrown weapon or piece of ammunition returns to normal size immediately after it hits or misses a target.

**_Enlarge._** The target's size increases by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. The target also has Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its enlarged weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can affect and be affected only by creatures, objects, and effects on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive or interact with you unless a feature gives them the ability to do so.

When the spell ends, you return to the plane you left in the spot that corresponds to your space in the Border Ethereal. If you appear in an occupied space, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take Force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

This spell ends instantly if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn't border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a save against this casting of the spell.

**_Asleep._** The target has the Unconscious condition. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

**_Panicked._** The target has the Frightened condition. On each of its turns, the Frightened target must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest route available. If the target moves to a space at least 60 feet away from you where it can't see you, this effect ends.

You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot Cube or eight connected 5-foot Cubes) given a sufficient quantity of material. If you're working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a 5-foot Cube). The quality of any fabricated objects is based on the quality of the raw materials.

No one but you can see the hound, and it is intangible and invulnerable. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound has Truesight with a range of 30 feet.

At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one enemy within 5 feet of it. That enemy must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d8 Force damage.

A Frightened creature takes the Dash action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form (see "Monsters"), though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.

**_Telepathic Connection._** While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.

**_Combat._** The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

**_Disappearance of the Familiar._** When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.

**_One Familiar Only._** You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.

#### Find Steed

*Level 2 Conjuration (Paladin)*

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Component:** V, S

The steed resembles a Large, rideable animal of your choice, such as a horse, a camel, a dire wolf, or an elk. Whenever you cast the spell, choose the steed's creature type—Celestial, Fey, or Fiend which determines certain traits in the stat block.

**_Combat._** The steed is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count, and it functions as a controlled mount while you ride it (as defined in the rules on mounted combat). If you have the Incapacitated condition, the steed takes its turn immediately after yours and acts independently, focusing on protecting you.

**_Disappearance of the Steed._** The steed disappears if it drops to 0 Hit Points or if you die. When it disappears, it leaves behind anything it was wearing or carrying. If you cast this spell again, you decide whether you summon the steed that disappeared or a different one.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

On a successful save, its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn. Constructs automatically succeed on the save.

A Restrained target makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and has the Petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If you maintain your Concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the target is Petrified until the condition is ended by *Greater Restoration* or similar magic.

#### Floating Disk

*Level 1 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury) 

**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.

The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

**Duration:** 1 day

You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the *Gate* spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, the Feywild, the Shadowfell, or the *Plane Shift* spell.

In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead. When a creature of a chosen type enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).

You can designate a password when you cast the spell. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.

The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another *Forbiddance* spell. If you cast *Forbiddance* every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the Material components are consumed on the last casting.

**Casting Time:** Action **Range:** 100 feet **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500+ GP, which the spell consumes) **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

An immobile, Invisible, Cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside it, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside it.

A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failed save, the creature doesn't exit the cage and wastes the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

This spell can't be dispelled by *Dispel Magic*.

#### Foresight

*Level 9 Divination (Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target has Advantage on D20 Tests, and other creatures have Disadvantage on attack rolls against it. The spell ends early if you cast it again.

#### Freedom of Movement

*Level 4 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap)

kj**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by Difficult Terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's Speed nor cause the target to have the Paralyzed or Restrained conditions. The target also has a Swim Speed equal to its Speed.

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the Grappled condition on it.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

### Freezing Sphere

*Level 6 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 300 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature crystal sphere) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid globe streaks from you to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

If the globe strikes a body of water, it freezes the water to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice and have the Restrained condition. A trapped creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC to break free.

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell's casting. If you do so, a globe about the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.

*Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.* The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 6.

### G Spells

#### Gaseous Form

*Level 3 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of gauze) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A willing creature you touch shape-shifts, along with everything it's wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends on the target if it drops to 0 Hit Points or if it takes a Magic action to end the spell on itself.

While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a Fly Speed of 10 feet, and it can hover. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage; it has Immunity to the Prone condition; and it has Advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through narrow openings, but it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces.

The target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. Finally, the target can't attack or cast spells.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 3.

#### Gate

*Level 9 Conjuration (Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 5,000+ GP) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration, and the portal's destination is visible through it.

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens next to the named creature and transports it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

#### Geas

*Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** 30 days

You give a verbal command to a creature that you can see within range, ordering it to carry out some service or refrain from an action or a course of activity as you decide. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. The target automatically succeeds if it can't understand your command.

While Charmed, the creature takes 5d10 Psychic damage if it acts in a manner directly counter to your command. It takes this damage no more than once each day.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

A *Remove Curse*, *Greater Restoration*, or *Wish* spell ends this spell.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** If you use a level 7 or 8 spell slot, the duration is 365 days. If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

#### Gentle Repose

*Level 2 Necromancy (Cleric, Paladin, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (2 Copper Pieces, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** 10 days

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can't become Undead.

The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit of spells such as *Raise Dead*.

#### Giant Insect

*Level 4 Conjuration (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You summon a giant centipede, spider, or wasp (chosen when you cast the spell). It manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses the **Giant Insect** stat block. The form you choose determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

#### Glibness

*Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Warlock)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** 1 hour

Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.

#### Globe of Invulnerability

*Level 6 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a glass bead)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

An immobile, shimmering barrier appears in a 10 foot Emanation around you and remains for the duration.

Any spell of level 5 or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect anything within it. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from areas of effect created by such spells.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The barrier blocks spells of 1 level higher for each spell slot level above 6.

#### Glyph of Warding

*Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200+ GP, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice.

When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it's an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below.

**_Set the Trigger._** You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

**_Explosive Rune._** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Spell Glyph._** You can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.

When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage of an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the spell slot you use for the *Glyph of Warding*.

#### Goodberry

*Level 1 Conjuration (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe) 

**Duration:** 24 hours

Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.

#### Grease

*Level 1 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter) 

**Duration:** 1 minute

Nonflammable grease covers the ground in a 10 foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into Difficult Terrain for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on that save or fall Prone.

#### Greater Invisibility

*Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

#### Guardian of Faith

**Duration:** 8 hours

Any enemy that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 20 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.

#### Guards and Wards

*Level 6 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (a silver rod worth 10+ GP) 

**Duration:** 24 hours

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space. The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and you shape it as one 50-foot square, one hundred 5-foot squares that are contiguous, or twenty-five 10-foot squares that are contiguous.

When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by the spell's effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud within 5 feet of the warded area, makes the speaker immune to its effects.

The spell creates the effects below within the warded area. *Dispel Magic* has no effect on *Guards and Wards* itself, but each of the following effects can be dispelled. If all four are dispelled, *Guards and Wards* ends. If you cast the spell every day for 365 days on the same area, the spell thereafter lasts until all its effects are dispelled.

**_Corridors._** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them Heavily Obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you believes it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

**_Doors._** All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by the *Arcane Lock* spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

**_Stairs._** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as in the *Web* spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are destroyed while *Guards and Wards* lasts.

**_Other Spell Effect._** Place one of the following magical effects within the warded area:

- *Dancing Lights* in four corridors, with a simple program that the lights repeat as long as *Guards and Wards* lasts
- *Magic Mouth* in two locations
- *Stinking Cloud* in two locations (the vapors return within 10 minutes if dispersed while *Guards and Wards* lasts)
- *Gust of Wind* in one corridor or room (the wind blows continuously while the spell lasts)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A Line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the duration.

A creature that ends its turn in the Line must make the same save.

Any creature in the Line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.

The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.

### H Spells

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy or unholy power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect of *Hallow*. The affected area has the following effects.

**_Hallowed Ward._** Choose any of these creature types: Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead. Creatures of the chosen types can't willingly enter the area, and any creature that is possessed by or that has the Charmed or Frightened condition from such creatures isn't possessed, Charmed, or Frightened by them while in the area.

**Range:** 300 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a mushroom) 

**Duration:** 24 hours

You make natural terrain in a 150-foot Cube in range look, sound, and smell like another sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to notice the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature examining the illusion can take the Study action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. If a creature discerns that the terrain is illusory, the creature sees a vague image superimposed on the real terrain.

**Duration:** 10 days

You write on parchment, paper, or another suitable material and imbue it with an illusion that lasts for the duration. To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, seems to be written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, the illusion can alter the meaning, handwriting, and language of the text, though the language must be one you know.

If the spell is dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.

A creature that has Truesight can read the hidden message.

#### Imprisonment

*Level 9 Abjuration (Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of the target worth 5,000+ GP) 

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target is unaffected, and it is immune to this

spell for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the target is imprisoned. While imprisoned, the target doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the imprisoned target, and the target can't teleport.

Until the spell ends, the target is also affected by one of the following effects of your choice:

**Burial.** The target is entombed beneath the earth in a hollow globe of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass into or out of the globe.
**Chaining.** Chains firmly rooted in the ground hold the target in place. The target has the Restrained condition and can't be moved by any means.
**Hedged Prison.** The target is trapped in a demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane is your choice of a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or the like.
**Minimus Containment.** The target becomes 1 inch tall and is trapped inside an indestructible gemstone or a similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through by any means.
**Slumber.** The target has the Unconscious condition and can't be awoken.

**_Ending the Spell._** When you cast the spell, specify a trigger that will end it. The trigger can be as simple or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that it has a high likelihood of happening within the next decade. The trigger must be an observable action, such as someone making a particular offering at the temple of your god, saving your true love, or defeating a specific monster.

A *Dispel Magic* spell can end the spell only if it is cast with a level 9 spell slot, targeting either the prison or the component used to create it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns.

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.

You touch the sapphire used in the casting and an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an Invisible mark on that object and invisibly inscribes the object's name on the sapphire. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.

Thereafter, you can take a Magic action to speak the object's name and crush the sapphire. The object instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.

If another creature is holding or carrying the object, crushing the sapphire doesn't transport it, but instead you learn who that creature is and where that creature is currently located.

#### Irresistible Dance

*Level 6 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target dances comically until the end of its next turn, during which it must spend all its movement to dance in place.

On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition for the duration. While Charmed, the target dances comically, must use all its movement to dance in place, and has Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls, and other creatures have Advantage on attack rolls against it. On each of its turns, the target can take an action to collect itself and repeat the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If the target is held shut by *Arcane Lock*, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and closed.

When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible up to 300 feet away, emanates from the target.

#### Legend Lore

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Name or describe a famous person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about that famous thing, as described by the GM.

The lore might consist of important details, amusing revelations, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. The more information you already know about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is. That information is accurate but might be couched in figurative language or poetry, as determined by the GM.

If the famous thing you chose isn't actually famous, you hear sad musical notes played on a trombone, and the spell fails.

One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically up to 20 feet and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate an object that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can take a Magic action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature's location if that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific creature known to you or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) if you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as under the effects of a *Flesh to Stone* or *Polymorph* spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.

As a Magic action on your later turns, you can control the hand thus again. As part of that action, you can move the hand up to 30 feet.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

- The creature can't willingly enter the Cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
- The creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the Cylinder.
- Targets within the Cylinder can't be possessed by or gain the Charmed or Frightened condition from the creature.

Each time you cast this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the Cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level above 3.

#### Magic Jar

*Level 6 Necromancy (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem, crystal, or reliquary worth 500+ GP)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell's Material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space. You can't move or take Reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a Humanoid's body.

You can attempt to possess any Humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a *Protection from Evil and Good* or *Magic Circle* spell can't be possessed). The target makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul enters the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a successful save, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Speed, and senses are replaced by the creature's. You otherwise keep your game statistics.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move and it is Incapacitated.

While possessing a body, you can take a Magic action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

#### Magic Missile

*Level 1 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart strikes a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 Force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The spell creates one more dart for each spell slot level above 1.

#### Magic Mouth

*Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (jade dust worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You implant a message within an object in range—a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there, so the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

#### Magic Weapon

*Level 2 Transmutation (Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action 

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. The spell ends early if you cast it again.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The bonus increases to +2 with a level 3–5 spell slot. The bonus increases to +3 with a level 6+ spell slot.

#### Magnificent Mansion

*Level 7 Conjuration (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute 

**Range:** 300 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature door worth 15+ GP) 

**Duration:** 24 hours

You conjure a shimmering door in range that lasts for the duration. The door leads to an extradimensional dwelling and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the door remains open. You can open or close it (no action required) if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the door is imperceptible.

Beyond the door is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The dwelling's atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you like for the dwelling, but it can't exceed 50 contiguous 10-foot Cubes. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a ninecourse banquet for up to 100 people. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from it.

A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You determine the appearance of these servants and their attire. They are invulnerable and obey your commands. Each servant can perform tasks that a human could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can't leave the dwelling.

When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance.

#### Major Image

*Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can't deal damage or cause conditions.

If you are within range of the illusion, you can take a Magic action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring Concentration, if cast with a level 4+ spell slot.

**Components:** V, M (a snake's tongue) 

**Duration:** 24 hours

You suggest a course of activity—described in no more than 25 words—to twelve or fewer creatures you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would obviously deal damage to any of the targets or their allies. For example, you could say, "Walk to the village down that road, and help the villagers there harvest crops until sunset." Or you could say, "Now is not the time for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop in an hour."

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. Each Charmed target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends for a target upon completing it.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The duration is longer with a spell slot of level 7 (10 days), 8 (30 days), or 9 (366 days).

#### Maze

*Level 8 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can take a Study action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

#### Meld into Stone

*Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 8 hours

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, merging yourself and your equipment with the stone for the duration. You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.

While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with Disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use 5 feet of movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 Force damage to you. The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 Force damage to you. If expelled, you move into an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered and have the Prone condition.

#### Mending

*Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can't restore magic to such an object.

#### Message

*Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** S, M (a copper wire) 

**Duration:** 1 round

You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.

#### Meteor Swarm

*Level 9 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 1 mile 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6 Fire damage and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only once.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the object starts burning if it's flammable.

#### Mind Blank

*Level 8 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has Immunity to Psychic damage and the Charmed condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even *Wish*—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.

#### Mind Spike

*Level 2 Divination (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You drive a spike of psionic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it has the Invisible condition, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

#### Minor Illusion

*Illusion Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece) 

**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again.

If a creature takes a Study action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

**_Sound._** If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

**_Image._** If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

#### Mirage Arcane

*Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes 

**Range:** Sight 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 10 days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into Difficult Terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.

Creatures with Truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

#### Mirror Image

*Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real.

Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll during the spell's duration, roll a d6 for each of your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.

#### Mislead

*Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You gain the Invisible condition at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.

As a Magic action, you can move the illusory double up to twice your Speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It is intangible and invulnerable.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is.

#### Misty Step

*Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

#### Modify Memory

*Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the target also has the Incapacitated condition and is unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change its memory of the event's details, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you finish describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as a false memory of how much the creature enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature.

A *Remove Curse* or *Greater Restoration* spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7 spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any time in the creature's past (level 9 spell slot).

#### Moonbeam

*Level 2 Evocation (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a moonseed leaf) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.

When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the *Polymorph* spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.

#### Move Earth

*Level 6 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature shovel) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 2 hours

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect within range.

This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

#### Nondetection

*Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Ranger, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** 8 hours

For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from Divination spells. The target can be a willing creature, or it can be a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can't be targeted by any Divination spell or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

### P Spells

#### **Passwall**

*Level 5 Transmutation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds) 

**Duration:** 1 hour

A passage appears at a point that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, ceiling, or floor) within range and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening's dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.

When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.

#### Pass without Trace

*Level 2 Abjuration (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from burned mistletoe) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You radiate a concealing aura in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and each creature you choose have a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and leave no tracks.

#### Phantasmal Force

*Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli.

The target can take a Study action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with it. For example, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall.

An affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

#### Phantasmal Killer

*Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusion of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d10 Psychic damage and has Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the spell ends.

For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 4.

#### Phantom Steed

*Level 3 Illusion (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 1 hour

A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the **Riding Horse**  stat block (see "Monsters"), except it has a Speed of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage.

#### Planar Ally

*Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a Celestial, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM's choice).

When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.

Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.

A task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.

After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

#### Planar Binding

*Level 5 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** 24 hours

You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of the inverted version of the *Magic Circle* spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your commands to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your commands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your commands completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The duration increases with a spell slot of level 6 (10 days), 7 (30 days), 8 (180 days), and 9 (366 days).

#### Plane Shift

*Level 7 Conjuration (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth 250+ GP and attuned to a plane of existence) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as a specific city on the Elemental Plane of Fire or palace on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination, as determined by the GM.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

#### Plant Growth

*Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action (Overgrowth) or 8 hours (Enrichment) 

**Range:** 150 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below.

**_Overgrowth._** Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.

**_Enrichment._** All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. They can benefit from only one *Plant Growth* per year.

#### Poison Spray

*Necromancy Cantrip (Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You spray toxic mist at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 Poison damage.

**_Cantrip Upgrade._** The damage increases by 1d12 when you reach levels 5 (2d12), 11 (3d12), and 17 (4d12).

#### Polymorph

*Level 4 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into a Beast form for the duration. That form can be any Beast you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level if it doesn't have a Challenge Rating). The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point Dice. See the "Animals" section of "Monsters" for a sample of Beast stat blocks.

The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the Beast form. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.

The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.

#### Power Word Heal

*Level 9 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Component:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its Hit Points. If the creature has the Charmed, Frightened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, or Stunned condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the Prone condition, it can use its Reaction to stand up.

#### Power Word Kill

*Level 9 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Component:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You compel one creature you can see within range to die. If the target has 100 Hit Points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, it takes 12d12 Psychic damage.

#### Power Word Stun

*Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 Hit Points or fewer, it has the Stunned condition. Otherwise, its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn.

The Stunned target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.

#### Prayer of Healing

*Level 2 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to five creatures of your choice who remain within range for the spell's entire casting gain the benefits of a Short Rest and also regain 2d8 Hit Points. A creature can't be affected by this spell again until that creature finishes a Long Rest.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The healing increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

#### Prestidigitation

*Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 10 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Up to 1 hour

You create a magical effect within range. Choose the effect from the options below. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time.

**_Sensory Effect._** You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks,

a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. *Fire Play.* You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

**_Clean or Soil._** You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.

**_Minor Sensation._** You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.

**_Magic Mark._** You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.

**_Minor Creation._** You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand. It lasts until the end of your next turn. A trinket can deal no damage and has no monetary worth.

#### Prismatic Spray

*Level 7 Evocation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Eight rays of light flash from you in a 60-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll 1d8 to determine which color ray affects it, consulting the Prismatic Rays table.

Table: Prismatic Rays

| 1d8 | Ray                                                                                       |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | **Red.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Fire damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage.         |
| 2   | **Orange.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Acid damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage.      |
| 3   | **Yellow.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Lightning damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 4   | **Green.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Poison damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage.     |
| 5   | **Blue.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Cold damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage.        |
| 6   | **Indigo.** *Failed Save:* The target has the Restrained condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the Petrified condition until it is freed by an effect like the *Greater Restoration* spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. |
| 7   | **Violet.** *Failed Save:* The target has the Blinded condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (GM's choice). |
| 8   | **Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice, rerolling any 8.               |

#### Prismatic Wall

*Level 9 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 10 minutes

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point within range. Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you position the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the spell ends instantly without effect.

The wall sheds Bright Light within 100 feet and Dim Light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate when you cast the spell can pass through and be near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute.

The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature reaches into or passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the layers. Each layer forces the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described in the Prismatic Layers table.

The wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration. *Antimagic Field* has no effect on the wall, and *Dispel Magic* can affect only the violet layer.

Table: Prismatic Layers

| Order | Effects                      |
|-------|------------------------------|
| 1     | **Red.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Fire damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects*: Nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed if it takes at least 25 Cold damage. |

| 3     | **Yellow.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Lightning damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 60 Force damage. |
| 4     | **Green.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Poison damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* A *Passwall* spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. |
| 5     | **Blue.** *Failed Save:* 12d6 Cold damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 25 Fire damage. |
| 6     | **Indigo.** *Failed Save:* The target has the Restrained condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the Petrified condition until it is freed by an effect like the *Greater Restoration* spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. *Additional Effects:* Spells can't be cast through this layer, which is destroyed by Bright Light shed by the *Daylight* spell. |
| 7     | **Violet.** *Failed Save:* The target has the Blinded condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (GM's choice). *Additional Effects:* This layer is destroyed by *Dispel Magic*. |

#### Private Sanctum

*Level 4 Abjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead) 

**Duration:** 24 hours

You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a Cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any of the following properties:

- Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including Darkvision) through it.
- Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
- Creatures in the area can't be targeted by Divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for 365 days makes the spell last until dispelled.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You can increase the size of the Cube by 100 feet for each spell slot level above 4.

#### Produce Flame

*Conjuration Cantrip (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Fire damage.

**_Cantrip Upgrade._** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

#### Programmed Illusion

*Level 6 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (jade dust worth 25+ GP) 

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific trigger occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot Cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the trigger you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes, after which the illusion can be activated again.

The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible phenomena that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes the Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

#### Project Image

*Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 500 miles 

**Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of yourself worth 5+ GP)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you, but it is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

You can see through the illusion's eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. As a Magic action, you can move it up to 60 feet and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes the Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

#### Protection from Energy

*Level 3 Abjuration (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Concentration up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against creatures that are Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have Disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be possessed by or gain the Charmed or Frightened conditions from them. If the target is already possessed, Charmed, or Frightened by such a creature, the target has Advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 500+ GP, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

With a touch, you revive a dead creature if it has been dead no longer than 10 days and it wasn't Undead when it died.

The creature returns to life with 1 Hit Point. This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to D20 Tests. Every time the target finishes a Long Rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it becomes 0.

#### Ray of Enfeeblement

*Level 2 Necromancy (Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S

A beam of enervating energy shoots from you toward a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the target has Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.

On a failed save, the target has Disadvantage on Strength-based D20 Tests for the duration. During that time, it also subtracts 1d8 from all its damage rolls. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a dead Humanoid or a piece of one. If the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new body for it and calls the soul to enter that body. Roll 1d10 and consult the table below to determine the body's species, or the GM chooses another playable species.

| 5    | Gnome       |
| 6    | Goliath     |
| 7    | Halfling    |
| 8    | Human       |
| 9    | Orc         |
| 10   | Tiefling    |

The reincarnated creature makes any choices that a species' description offers, and the creature recalls its former life. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it loses the traits of its previous species and gains the traits of its new one.

#### Remove Curse

*Level 3 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's Attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

#### Resilient Sphere

*Level 4 Abjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a glass sphere) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A shimmering sphere encloses a Large or smaller creature or object within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can take an action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's Speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A *Disintegrate* spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside.

#### Resistance

*Abjuration Cantrip (Cleric, Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Component:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a willing creature and choose a damage type: Acid, Bludgeoning, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Piercing, Poison, Radiant, Slashing, or Thunder. When the creature takes damage of the chosen type before the spell ends, the creature reduces the total damage taken by 1d4. A creature can benefit from this spell only once per turn.

#### Resurrection

*Level 7 Necromancy (Bard, Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

With a touch, you revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, didn't die of old age, and wasn't Undead when it died.

The creature returns to life with all its Hit Points. This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death. This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to D20 Tests. Every time the target finishes a Long Rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it becomes 0.

Casting this spell to revive a creature that has been dead for 365 days or longer taxes you. Until you finish a Long Rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have Disadvantage on D20 Tests.

#### Reverse Gravity

*Level 7 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 100 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100 foot high Cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects in that area that aren't anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the Cylinder. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall upward.

If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it just as they would during a downward fall. If an affected creature or object reaches the Cylinder's top without striking anything, it hovers there for the duration. When the spell ends, affected objects and creatures fall downward.

#### Revivify

*Level 3 Necromancy (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 300+ GP, which the spell consumes)

*Level 2 Transmutation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (a segment of rope) 

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a rope. One end of it hovers upward until the rope hangs perpendicular to the ground or the rope reaches a ceiling. At the rope's upper end, an Invisible 3-foot-by-5-foot portal opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends. That space can be reached by climbing the rope, which can be pulled into or dropped out of it.

The space can hold up to eight Medium or smaller creatures. Attacks, spells, and other effects can't pass into or out of the space, but creatures inside it can see through the portal. Anything inside the space drops out when the spell ends.

### S Spells

*Evocation Cantrip (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action

Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack roll or a damaging spell must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or either choose a new target or lose the attack or spell.

#### Scorching Ray

*Level 2 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl three fiery rays. You can hurl them at one target within range or at several. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 Fire damage.

#### Scrying

*Level 5 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes 

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth 1,000+ GP, such as a crystal ball, mirror, or water-filled font) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You can see and hear a creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified (see the tables below) by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. The target doesn't know what it is making the save against, only that it feels uneasy.

| Your Knowledge of the Target Is …       | Save Modifier |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------|
| Secondhand (heard of the target)        | +5            |
| Firsthand (met the target)              | +0            |
| Extensive (know the target well)        | −5            |

| You Have the Target's …                 | Save Modifier |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------|
| Picture or other likeness               | −2            |
| Garment or other possession             | −4            |
| Body part, lock of hair, or bit of nail | −10           |

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell on it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the spell creates an Invisible, intangible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. If something can see the sensor, it appears as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can target a location you have seen. When you do so, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

#### Searing Smite

*Level 1 Evocation (Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting a target with a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike

**Range:** Self 

**Component:** V 

**Duration:** 1 minute

As you hit the target, it takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage from the attack. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target takes 1d6 Fire damage and then makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell continues. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** All the damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.

#### Secret Chest

*Level 4 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth 5,000+ GP, and a Tiny replica of the chest made from the same materials worth 50+ GP)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You hide a chest and all its contents on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serve as Material components for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).

While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can take a Magic action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by taking a Magic action to touch the chest and the replica.

After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance at the end of each day that the spell ends. The spell also ends if you cast this spell again or if the Tiny replica chest is destroyed. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, the chest remains there for you or someone else to find.

#### See Invisibility

*Level 2 Divination (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of talc) 

**Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you see creatures and objects that have the Invisible condition as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Creatures and objects there appear ghostly.

#### Seeming

*Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 8 hours

You give an illusory appearance to each creature of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.

You can give the same appearance or different ones to the targets. The spell can change the appearance of the targets' bodies and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target's new appearance must have the same basic arrangement of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the duration.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat.

A creature that takes the Study action to examine a target can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

#### Sending

*Level 3 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Unlimited 

**Components:** V, S, M (a copper wire) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You send a short message of 25 words or fewer to a creature you have met or a creature described to you by someone who has met it. The target hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables targets to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive. You know if the delivery fails.

Upon receiving your message, a creature can block your ability to reach it again with this spell for 8 hours. If you try to send another message during that time, you learn that you are blocked, and the spell fails.

#### Sequester

*Level 7 Transmutation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (gem dust worth 5,000+ GP, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** Until dispelled

With a touch, you magically sequester an object or a willing creature. For the duration, the target has the Invisible condition and can't be targeted by Divination spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely with magic.

If the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn't age, and doesn't need food, water, or air.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

#### Shapechange

*Level 9 Transmutation (Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth 1,500+ GP) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You shape-shift into another creature for the duration or until you take a Magic action to shape-shift into a different eligible form. The new form must be of a creature that has a Challenge Rating no higher than your level or Challenge Rating. You must have seen the sort of creature before, and it can't be a Construct or an Undead.

When you cast the spell, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the first form into which you shape-shift. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell ends.

Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.

Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.

#### Shatter

*Level 2 Evocation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d8 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has Disadvantage on the save.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

#### Shield

*Level 1 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack roll or targeted by the *Magic Missile* spell

**Range:** Self

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (mistletoe) 

**Duration:** 1 minute

A Club or Quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. If the attack deals damage, it can be Force damage or the weapon's normal damage type (your choice).

The spell ends early if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

**_Cantrip Upgrade._** The damage die changes when you reach levels 5 (d10), 11 (d12), and 17 (2d6).

#### Shining Smite

*Level 2 Transmutation (Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike

**Range:** Self

**Component:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The target hit by the strike takes an extra 2d6 Radiant damage from the attack. Until the spell ends, the target sheds Bright Light in a 5-foot radius, attack rolls against it have Advantage, and it can't benefit from the Invisible condition.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 2.

#### Shocking Grasp

*Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Lightning springs from you to a creature that you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Lightning damage, and it can't make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.

**_Cantrip Upgrade._** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

#### Silence

*Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Cleric, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the Sphere has Immunity to Thunder damage, and creatures have the Deafened condition while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a Verbal component is impossible there.

#### Silent Image

*Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

As a Magic action, you can cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

#### Simulacrum

*Level 7 Illusion (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 12 hours 

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered ruby worth 1,500+ GP, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You create a simulacrum of one Beast or Humanoid that is within 10 feet of you for the entire casting of the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same size as that creature, and the pile turns into the simulacrum, which is a creature. It uses the game statistics of the original creature at the time of casting, except it is a Construct, its Hit Point maximum is half as much, and it can't cast this spell.

The simulacrum is Friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your commands and acts on your turn in combat. The simulacrum can't gain levels, and it can't take Short or Long Rests.

If the simulacrum takes damage, the only way to restore its Hit Points is to repair it as you take a Long Rest, during which you expend components worth 100 GP per Hit Point restored. The simulacrum must stay within 5 feet of you for the repair.

The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 Hit Points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts away. If you cast this spell again, any simulacrum you created with this spell is instantly destroyed.

#### Sleep

*Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sand or rose petals) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the Unconscious condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.

Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.

#### Sleet Storm

*Level 3 Conjuration (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 150 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature umbrella) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, sleet falls in a 40-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius Cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. The area is Heavily Obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

Ground in the Cylinder is Difficult Terrain. When a creature enters the Cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a

Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition and lose Concentration.

#### Slow

*Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot Cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target's Speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the Attack action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.

An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.

#### Sorcerous Burst

*Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Component:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 damage of a type you choose: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder.

If you roll an 8 on a d8 for this spell, you can roll another d8, and add it to the damage. When you cast this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you can add to the spell's damage equals your spellcasting ability modifier.

**_Cantrip Upgrade._** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

#### Spare the Dying

*Necromancy Cantrip (Cleric, Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 15 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a creature within range that has 0 Hit Points and isn't dead. The creature becomes Stable.

**_Cantrip Upgrade._** The range doubles when you reach levels 5 (30 feet), 11 (60 feet), and 17 (120 feet).

#### Speak with Animals

*Level 1 Divination (Bard, Druid, Ranger, Warlock)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 10 minutes

For the duration, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with Beasts, and you can use any of the Influence action's skill options with them.

Most Beasts have little to say about topics that don't pertain to survival or companionship, but at minimum, a Beast can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever it has perceived within the past day.

#### Speak with Dead

*Level 3 Necromancy (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 10 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense) 

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You grant the semblance of life to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer questions you pose. The corpse must have a mouth, and this spell fails if the deceased creature was Undead when it died. The spell also fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the past 10 days.

Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

#### Speak with Plants

*Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You imbue plants in an immobile 30-foot Emanation with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

You can also turn Difficult Terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into Difficult Terrain that lasts for the duration.

The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can move their branches, tendrils, and stalks for you.

If a Plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language.

#### Spider Climb

*Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)

**Range:** 150 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (seven thorns) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes Difficult Terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast must take a Search action and succeed on a Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

#### Spirit Guardians

*Level 3 Conjuration (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S, M (a prayer scroll) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Protective spirits flit around you in a 15-foot Emanation for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.

When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature's Speed is halved in the Emanation, and whenever the Emanation enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 Necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.

#### Spiritual Weapon

*Level 2 Evocation (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral force that resembles a weapon of your choice and lasts for the duration. The force appears within range in a space of your choice, and you can immediately make one melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of the force. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can move the force up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 2.

You launch a mote of light at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Radiant damage, and until the end of your next turn, it emits Dim Light in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the Invisible condition.

**_Cantrip Upgrade._** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

#### Stinking Cloud

*Level 3 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 90 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is Heavily Obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by *Gust of Wind*) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition until the end of the current turn. While Poisoned in this way, the creature can't take an action or a Bonus Action.

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (soft clay)

At the start of each of your later turns, the storm produces different effects, as detailed below.

**_Turn 2._** Acidic rain falls. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 4d6 Acid damage.

**_Turn 3._** You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six different creatures or objects beneath it. Each target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Turn 4._** Hailstones rain down. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage.

**_Turns 5–10._** Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. Each creature there takes 1d6 Cold damage. Until the spell ends, the area is Difficult Terrain and Heavily Obscured, ranged attacks with weapons are impossible there, and strong wind blows through the area.

#### Suggestion

*Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, M (a drop of honey) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You suggest a course of activity—described in no more than 25 words—to one creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would obviously deal damage to the target or its allies. For example, you could say, "Fetch the key to the cult's treasure vault, and give the key to me." Or you could say, "Stop fighting, leave this library peacefully, and don't return."

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. The Charmed target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

#### Symbol

*Level 7 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice.

When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death, Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is explained below.

**_Set the Trigger._** You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph.

You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature is targeted only once per turn.

**_Death._** Each target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.

**_Discord._** Each target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

**_Fear._** Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While Frightened, the target must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.

**_Pain._** Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition for 1 minute.

**_Sleep._** Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Unconscious condition for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone takes an action to shake it awake.

**_Stunning._** Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Stunned condition for 1 minute.

### T Spells

#### Telekinesis

*Level 5 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell and as a Magic action on your later turns before the spell ends, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

**_Creature._** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range. Until the end of your next turn, the creature has the Restrained condition, and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended there. It falls at the end of your next turn unless you use this option on it again and it fails the save.

**_Object._** You can try to move a Huge or smaller object. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you pull the object away and move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool,

#### Telepathic Bond

*Level 5 Divination (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (two eggs) 

**Duration:** 1 hour

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures that can't communicate in any languages aren't affected by this spell.

Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they share a language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence.

#### Teleport

*Level 7 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 10 feet 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be Large or smaller, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls 1d100 and consults the Teleportation Outcome table and the explanations after it.

Table: Teleportation Outcome

| Familiarity              | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |
|--------------------------|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|

**_Familiarity._** Here are the meanings of the terms in the table's Familiarity column:

- "Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.
- "Linked object" means you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library.
- "Very familiar" is a place you have visited often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.
- "Seen casually" is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.
- "Viewed once or described" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.
- "False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists.

**_Mishap._** The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

**_Similar Area._** You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory in the same city.

**_Off Target._** You and your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 for the direction: 1, east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.

**_On Target._** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended.

#### **Teleportation Circle**

*Level 5 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, M (rare inks worth 50+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 round

As you cast the spell, you draw a 5-foot-radius circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guildhalls, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles. Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of runes arranged in a particular pattern.

When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You might learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for 365 days.

#### Thaumaturgy

**_Invisible Hand._** You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.

**_Phantom Sound._** You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.

#### Thunderwavea

*Level 1 Evocation (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1.

#### Time Stop

*Level 9 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.

This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during it, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.

#### Tiny Hut

*Level 3 Evocation (Bard, Wizard)* 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual 

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a crystal bead) 

**Duration:** 8 hours

A 10-foot Emanation springs into existence around you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell fails when you cast it if the Emanation isn't big enough to fully encapsulate all creatures in its area.

Creatures and objects within the Emanation when you cast the spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can't be cast through it, and the effects of such spells can't extend into it.

The atmosphere inside the Emanation is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to have Dim Light or Darkness (no action required). The Emanation is opaque from the outside and of any color you choose, but it's transparent from the inside.

The spell ends early if you leave the Emanation or if you cast it again.

#### Tongues

*Level 3 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, M (a miniature ziggurat) 

**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken or signed language that it hears or sees. Moreover, when the target communicates by speaking or signing, any creature that

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 10 feet 

**Components:** V, S

#### Tree Stride

*Level 5 Conjuration (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you're in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.

You can use this transportation ability only once on each of your turns. You must end each turn outside a tree.

#### True Polymorph

*Level 9 Transmutation (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. The creature shape-shifts into a different creature or a nonmagical object, or the object shape-shifts into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried). The transformation lasts for the duration or until the target dies or is destroyed, but if you maintain Concentration on this spell for the full duration, the spell lasts until dispelled.

An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.

**_Creature into Creature._** If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the target's Challenge Rating or level. The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the new form, but it retains its Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, alignment, and personality.

The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the new form. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell ends.

The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.

**_Object into Creature._** You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature has a Challenge Rating of 9 or lower. The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. In combat, it takes its turns immediately after yours, and it obeys your commands.

If the spell lasts more than an hour, you no longer control the creature. It might remain Friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.

**_Creature into Object._** If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object's size is no larger than the creature's size. The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form after the spell ends and it returns to normal.

#### True Resurrection

*Level 9 Necromancy (Cleric, Druid)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (diamonds worth 25,000+ GP, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. The creature is revived with all its Hit Points.

This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all magical contagions, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was Undead, it is restored to its non-Undead form.

The spell can provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

#### True Seeing

*Level 6 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch 

**Components:** V, S, M (mushroom powder worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes) 

**Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, the willing creature you touch has Truesight with a range of 120 feet.

#### True Strike

*Divination Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** S, M (a weapon with which you have proficiency and that is worth 1+ CP)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Guided by a flash of magical insight, you make one attack with the weapon used in the spell's casting. The attack uses your spellcasting ability for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity. If the attack deals damage, it can be Radiant damage or the weapon's normal damage type (your choice).

**_Cantrip Upgrade._** Whether you deal Radiant damage or the weapon's normal damage type, the attack deals extra Radiant damage when you reach levels 5 (1d6), 11 (2d6), and 17 (3d6).

#### Tsunami

*Level 8 Conjuration (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute 

**Range:** 1 mile 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 6 rounds

A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 6d10 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 Bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage the wall deals on later rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.

A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the wave's force, though, the creature must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC to move at all. If it fails the check, it can't move. A creature that moves out of the wall falls to the ground.

### U-Z Spells

#### Unseen Servant

*Level 1 Conjuration (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of string and of wood) 

**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell creates an Invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 Hit Point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

#### Vampiric Touch

*Level 3 Necromancy (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain Hit Points equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a Magic action, targeting the same creature or a different one.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 3.

*Enchantment Cantrip (Bard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at one creature you can see or hear within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d6 Psychic damage and have Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

**_Cantrip Upgrade._** The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).

#### Vitriolic Sphere

*Level 4 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 150 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of bile) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You point at a location within range, and a glowing, 1-foot-diameter ball of acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 Acid damage and another 5d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage only.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The initial damage increases by 2d4 for each spell slot level above 4.

#### Wall of Fire

*Level 4 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of charcoal) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 Fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.

#### Wall of Force

*Level 5 Evocation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a shard of glass) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An Invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by *Dispel Magic.* A *Disintegrate* spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane and blocks ethereal travel through the wall.

#### Wall of Ice

*Level 6 Evocation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of quartz) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 Hit Points per 10-foot section, and it has Immunity to Cold, Poison, and Psychic damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 Hit Points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.

A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6 and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 6.

#### Wall of Stone

*Level 5 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a cube of granite) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-footby-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on a firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create battlements and the like.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM's discretion.

If you maintain your Concentration on this spell for its full duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

#### Wall of Thorns

*Level 6 Conjuration (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of thorns) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** Both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 6.

#### Warding Bond

*Level 2 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth 50+ GP each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch another creature that is willing and create a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has Resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures.

#### Water Breathing

*Level 3 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a short reed) 

**Duration:** 24 hours

This spell grants up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.

#### Water Walk

*Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual 

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cork) 

**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range gain this ability for the duration.

An affected target must take a Bonus Action to pass from the liquid's surface into the liquid itself and vice versa, but if the target falls into the liquid, the target passes through the surface into the liquid below.

#### Web

*Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain, and the area within them is Lightly Obscured.

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature Restrained by the webs can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

#### Weird

*Level 9 Illusion (Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You try to create illusory terrors in others' minds. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 10d10 Psychic damage and has the Frightened condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

A Frightened target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends on that target.

#### Wind Walk

*Level 6 Transmutation (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute 

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a candle) 

**Duration:** 8 hours

You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and can hover; it has Immunity to the Prone condition; and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the Dash action or a Magic action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the target has the Stunned condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a Magic action followed by a 1-minute transformation.

If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance.

#### Wind Wall

*Level 3 Evocation (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a fan and a feather) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and miss automatically. Boulders hurled by Giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected. Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it.

#### Wish

*Level 9 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** Self 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

*Wish* is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.

The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

**_Object Creation._** You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.
**_Instant Health._** You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the *Greater Restoration* spell.
**_Resistance._** You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.
**_Spell Immunity._** You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.
**_Sudden Learning._** You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.
**_Roll Redo._** You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a *Wish* spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
**_Reshape Reality._** You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game.

Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, your wish fails.

The stress of casting *Wish* to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast *Wish* ever again if you suffer this stress.

#### Word of Recall

*Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 5 feet 

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.

You must designate a location, such as a temple, as a sanctuary by casting this spell there.

#### Zone of Truth

*Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature succeeds or fails on this save.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive yet must be truthful.

# Rules Glossary

## Glossary Conventions

The glossary uses the following conventions:

**Tags in Brackets.** Some entries have a tag in brackets after the entry's name, as in "Attack [Action]." A tag—Action, Area of Effect, Attitude, Condition, or Hazard—indicates that a rule is part of a family of rules. The tags also have glossary entries.

**"You."** The game's rules—in this glossary and elsewhere—often talk about something happening to you in the game world. That "you" refers to the creature or object that the rule applies to in a particular moment of play. For example, the "you" in the Prone condition is a creature that currently has that condition.

**"See Also."** Some glossary entries include a *See also* section that points to other entries in the glossary, to other parts of this document, or both.

**No Obsolete Terms.** The glossary contains definitions of current rules terms only. If you're looking for a term from an earlier version of the fifth edition rules, consult the index.

## Rules Definitions

Here are definitions of various rules.

#### Ability Check

An ability check is a D20 Test that represents using one of the six abilities—or a specific skill associated with an ability—to overcome a challenge. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("D20 Tests" and "Proficiency").

#### Ability Score and Modifier

A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—each of which has a corresponding modifier. Add the modifier when you make a D20 Test with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks you to do so. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("The Six Abilities").

#### Action

On your turn, you can take one action. Choose which action to take from those below or from the special actions provided by your features. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Actions"). These actions are defined elsewhere in this glossary:

|           |       |           |         |
|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Attack    | Dodge | Influence | Search  |
| Dash      | Help  | Magic     | Study   |
| Disengage | Hide  | Ready     | Utilize |

#### Advantage

If you have Advantage on a D20 Test, roll two d20s, and use the higher roll. A roll can't be affected by more than one Advantage, and Advantage and Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("D20 Tests").

#### Adventure

An adventure is a series of encounters. A story emerges through playing them. *See also* "Encounter."

#### Alignment

A creature's alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). These factors allow for nine possible combinations, such as Lawful Good and Neutral Evil. *See also* "Character Creation" ("Create Your Character").

#### Ally

A creature is your ally if it is a member of your adventuring party, your friend, on your side in combat, or a creature that the rules or the GM designates as your ally.

#### Area of Effect

The descriptions of many spells and other features specify that they have an area of effect, which typically has one of six shapes. These shapes are defined elsewhere in this glossary:

|      |           |        |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Cone | Cylinder  | Line   |
| Cube | Emanation | Sphere |

An area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the effect's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how to position its point of origin. If all straight lines extending from the point of origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked, that location isn't included in the area of effect. To block a line, an obstruction must provide Total Cover. *See also* "Cover."

If the creator of an area of effect places it at an unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall is between the creator and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of the obstruction.

#### Armor Class

An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an attack roll. AC represents how difficult it is to hit a target.

Your base AC calculation is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If a rule gives you another base AC calculation, you choose which calculation to use; you can't use more than one. *See also* "Attack Roll."

#### Armor Training

Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain category without the following drawbacks. If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training with it, you don't gain its AC bonus. *See also* "Disadvantage" and "Equipment" ("Armor").

#### Attack [Action]

When you take the Attack action, you can make one attack roll with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

**_Equipping and Unequipping Weapons._** You can either equip or unequip one weapon when you make an attack as part of this action. You do so either before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon before an attack, you don't need to use it for that attack. Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon includes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it.

**_Moving between Attacks._** If you move on your turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack action, you can use some or all of that movement to move between those attacks.

#### Attack Roll

An attack roll is a D20 Test that represents making an attack with a weapon, an Unarmed Strike, or a spell. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("D20 Tests").

#### Attitude

A monster has a starting attitude toward a player character: Friendly, Hostile, or Indifferent. *See also* "Friendly," "Hostile," "Indifferent," and "Influence."

#### Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond—called Attunement—with them before the creature can use an item's magical properties. A creature can have Attunement with no more than three magic items at a time. *See also* "Equipment" ("Magic Items").

#### Blinded [Condition]

While you have the Blinded condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Can't See._** You can't see and automatically fail any ability check that requires sight.

**_Attacks Affected._** Attack rolls against you have Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage.

#### Blindsight

If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific range without relying on physical sight. Within that range, you can see anything that isn't behind Total Cover even if you have the Blinded condition or are in Darkness. Moreover, in that range, you can see something that has the Invisible condition.

#### Bloodied

A creature is Bloodied while it has half its Hit Points or fewer remaining.

#### Bonus Action

A Bonus Action is a special action that you can take on the same turn that you take an action. You can't take more than one Bonus Action on a turn, and you have a Bonus Action to take only if a rule explicitly says so. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Actions").

#### Breaking Objects

Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceedingly fragile, the GM may allow a creature to break it automatically with the Attack or Utilize action.

**_Armor Class._** The Object Armor Class table suggests ACs for various substances.

Table: Object Armor Class

| AC | Substance           |
|----|---------------------|
| 11 | Cloth, paper, rope  |
| 13 | Crystal, glass, ice |
| 15 | Wood                |
| 17 | Stone               |
| 19 | Iron, steel         |
| 21 | Mithral             |
| 23 | Adamantine          |

**_Hit Points._** An object is destroyed when it has 0 Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargantuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's Hit Points separately. The GM determines whether destroying part of an object causes the whole thing to collapse.

Table: Object Hit Points

| Size                        | Fragile  | Resilient |
|-----------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Tiny (bottle, lock)         | 2 (1d4)  | 5 (2d4)   |
| Small (chest, lute)         | 3 (1d6)  | 10 (3d6)  |
| Medium (barrel, chandelier) | 4 (1d8)  | 18 (4d8)  |
| Large (cart, dining table)  | 5 (1d10) | 27 (5d10) |

**_Damage Types and Objects._** Objects have Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. The GM might decide that some damage types are more or less effective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnerability to Fire damage.

**_Damage Threshold._** Big objects, such as castle walls, often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. *See also* "Damage Threshold."
k
**_No Ability Scores._** An object lacks ability scores unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without ability scores, an object can't make ability checks, and it fails all saving throws.

#### Bright Light

Bright Light is normal illumination. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Exploration").

#### Burning [Hazard]

A burning creature or object takes 1d4 Fire damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself the Prone condition and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated.

#### Burrow Speed

A creature that has a Burrow Speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. The creature can't burrow through solid rock unless the creature has a trait that allows it to do so. *See also* "Speed."

#### Campaign

A campaign is a series of adventures. *See also* "Adventure."

#### Cantrip

A cantrip is a level 0 spell, which is cast without a spell slot. *See also* "Spells."

#### Carrying Capacity

Your size and Strength score determine the maximum weight in pounds that you can carry, as shown in the Carrying Capacity table. The table also shows the maximum weight you can drag, lift, or push.

While dragging, lifting, or pushing weight in excess of the maximum weight you can carry, your Speed can be no more than 5 feet.

Table: Carrying Capacity

| Creature Size | Carry          | Drag/Lift/Push |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Tiny          | Str. × 7.5 lb. | Str. × 15 lb.  |
| Small/Medium  | Str. × 15 lb.  | Str. × 30 lb.  |
| Large         | Str. × 30 lb.  | Str. × 60 lb.  |
| Huge          | Str. × 60 lb.  | Str. × 120 lb. |
| Gargantuan    | Str. × 120 lb. | Str. × 240 lb. |

#### Challenge Rating

Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a monster poses to a group of four player characters. Compare a monster's CR to the characters' level. If the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger. If the CR is lower, the monster likely poses little threat. But circumstances and the number of player characters can significantly alter how threatening a monster is in actual play. "Gameplay Toolbox" ("Combat Encounters") provides guidance to the GM on using CR while planning potential combat encounters. *See also* "Stat Block."

#### Character Sheet

A character sheet is a paper or digital record that you use to track your character's information. *See also* "Character Creation."

#### Charmed [Condition]

While you have the Charmed condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Can't Harm the Charmer._** You can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with damaging abilities or magical effects.

**_Social Advantage._** The charmer has Advantage on any ability check to interact with you socially.

#### Climbing

While you're climbing, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). You ignore this extra cost if you have a Climb Speed and use it to climb.

At the GM's option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds might require a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Climb Speed

A Climb Speed can be used in place of Speed to traverse a vertical surface without expending the extra movement normally associated with climbing. *See also* "Climbing" and "Speed."

#### Concentration

Some spells and other effects require Concentration to remain active, as specified in their descriptions. If the effect's creator loses Concentration, the effect ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the effect's description specifies how long the creator can concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some other duration. The creator can end Concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors break Concentration.

**_Another Concentration Effect._** You lose Concentration on an effect the moment you start casting a spell that requires Concentration or activate another effect that requires Concentration.

**_Damage._** If you take damage, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken (round down), whichever number is higher, up to a maximum DC of 30.

**_Incapacitated or Dead._** Your Concentration ends if you have the Incapacitated condition or you die.

#### Condition

A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions:

|            |               |             |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Blinded    | Grappled      | Poisoned    |
| Charmed    | Incapacitated | Prone       |
| Deafened   | Invisible     | Restrained  |
| Exhaustion | Paralyzed     | Stunned     |
| Frightened | Petrified     | Unconscious |

A condition doesn't stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn't. The Exhaustion condition is an exception to that rule.

#### Cone [Area of Effect]

A Cone is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator chooses. A Cone's width at any point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. For example, a Cone is 15 feet wide at a point along its length that is 15 feet from the point of origin. The effect that creates a Cone specifies its maximum length.

A Cone's point of origin isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

#### Cover

Cover provides a degree of protection to a target behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of which provides a different benefit to a target: Half Cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), Three-Quarters Cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), and Total Cover (can't be targeted directly). If behind more than one degree of cover, a target benefits only from the most protective degree. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Combat").

#### Crawling

While you're crawling, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). *See also* "Speed."

#### Creature

Any being in the game, including a player's character, is a creature. *See also* "Creature Type."

#### Creature Type

Every creature, including every player character, has a tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature it is. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. These are the game's creature types:

|            |           |             |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Aberration | Elemental | Monstrosity |
| Beast      | Fey       | Ooze        |
| Celestial  | Fiend     | Plant       |
| Construct  | Giant     | Undead      |
| Dragon     | Humanoid  |             |

The types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways.

#### Critical Hit

If you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, you score a Critical Hit, and the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. A Critical Hit lets you roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Damage and Healing").

#### Cube [Area of Effect]

A Cube is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin located anywhere on a face of the Cube. The effect that creates a Cube specifies its size, which is the length of each side.

A Cube's point of origin isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

#### Curses

Some game effects curse a creature or an object. The effect that confers a curse defines what the curse does. Curses can be removed by the *Remove Curse* and *Greater Restoration* spells or other magic that explicitly ends curses.

#### Cylinder [Area of Effect]

A Cylinder is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin located at the center of the circular top or bottom of the Cylinder. The effect that creates a Cylinder specifies the radius of the Cylinder's base and the Cylinder's height.

A Cylinder's point of origin is included in the area of effect.

#### D20 Test

D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of the game: ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. If something in the game affects D20 Tests, it affects all three of these rolls. The GM determines whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("D20 Tests").

#### Damage

Damage represents harm that causes a creature or an object to lose Hit Points.

#### Damage Roll

A damage roll is a die roll, adjusted by any applicable modifiers, that deals damage to a target. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Damage and Healing").

#### Damage Threshold

A creature or an object that has a damage threshold has Immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes that entire instance of damage. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is superficial and doesn't reduce Hit Points. For example, if an object has a damage threshold of 10, the object takes no damage if 9 damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11 damage, it takes all of that damage.

#### Damage Types

Attacks and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as Resistance, rely on the types. The Damage Types table offers examples to help a GM assign a type to a new effect.

Table: Damage Types

| Type        | Examples                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Acid        | Corrosive liquids, digestive enzymes |
| Bludgeoning | Blunt objects, constriction, falling |
| Cold        | Freezing water, icy blasts           |
| Fire        | Flames, unbearable heat              |
| Force       | Pure magical energy                  |
| Lightning   | Electricity                          |
| Necrotic    | Life-draining energy                 |
| Piercing    | Fangs, puncturing objects            |
| Poison      | Toxic gas, venom                     |
| Psychic     | Mind-rending energy                  |
| Radiant     | Holy energy, searing radiation       |
| Slashing    | Claws, cutting objects               |
| Thunder     | Concussive sound                     |

#### Darkness

An area of Darkness is Heavily Obscured. *See also* "Heavily Obscured" and "Playing the Game" ("Exploration").

#### Darkvision

If you have Darkvision, you can see in Dim Light within a specified range as if it were Bright Light and in Darkness within that range as if it were Dim Light. You discern colors in that Darkness only as shades of gray. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Exploration").

#### Dash [Action]

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your Speed after applying any modifiers. With a Speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you Dash. If your Speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you Dash.

If you have a special speed, such as a Fly Speed or Swim Speed, you can use that speed instead of your Speed when you take this action. You choose which speed to use each time you take it. *See also* "Speed."

#### Dead

A dead creature has no Hit Points and can't regain them unless it is first revived by magic such as the *Raise Dead* or *Revivify* spell. When such a spell is cast, the spirit knows who is casting it and can refuse. The spirit of a dead creature has left the body and departed for the Outer Planes, and reviving the creature requires calling the spirit back.

If the creature returns to life, the revival effect determines the creature's current Hit Points. Unless otherwise stated, the creature returns to life with any conditions, magical contagions, or curses that were affecting it at death if the durations of those effects are still ongoing. If the creature died with any Exhaustion levels, it returns with 1 fewer level. If the creature had Attunement to one or more magic items, it is no longer attuned to them.

#### Deafened [Condition]

While you have the Deafened condition, you experience the following effect.

**_Can't Hear._** You can't hear and automatically fail any ability check that requires hearing.

#### Death Saving Throw

A player character must make a Death Saving Throw (also called a Death Save) if they start their turn with 0 Hit Points. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Damage and Healing").

#### Dehydration [Hazard]

A creature requires an amount of water per day based on its size, as shown in the Water Needs per Day table. A creature that drinks less than half the required water for a day gains 1 Exhaustion level at the day's end. Exhaustion caused by dehydration can't be removed until the creature drinks the full amount of water required for a day. *See also* "Exhaustion."

Table: Water Needs per Day

| Size   | Water      | Size       | Water      |
|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| Tiny   | 1/4 gallon | Large      | 4 gallons  |
| Small  | 1 gallon   | Huge       | 16 gallons |
| Medium | 1 gallon   | Gargantuan | 64 gallons |

#### Difficult Terrain

If a space is Difficult Terrain, every foot of movement in that space costs 1 extra foot. For example, moving 5 feet through Difficult Terrain costs 10 feet of movement. Difficult Terrain isn't cumulative; either a space is Difficult Terrain or it isn't.

A space is Difficult Terrain if the space contains any of the following or something similar:

- A creature that isn't Tiny or your ally
- Furniture that is sized for creatures of your size or larger
- Heavy snow, ice, rubble, or undergrowth
- Liquid that's between shin- and waist-deep
- A narrow opening sized for a creature one size smaller than you
- A slope of 20 degrees or more

#### Difficulty Class

A Difficulty Class (DC) is the target number for an ability check or a saving throw. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("D20 Tests").

#### Dim Light

An area with Dim Light is Lightly Obscured. *See also* "Lightly Obscured" and "Playing the Game" ("Exploration").

#### Disadvantage

If you have Disadvantage on a D20 Test, roll two d20s and use the lower roll. A roll can't be affected by more than one Disadvantage, and Advantage and Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("D20 Tests").

#### Disengage [Action]

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the current turn.

#### Dodge [Action]

If you take the Dodge action, you gain the following benefits: until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has Disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with Advantage.

You lose these benefits if you have the Incapacitated condition or if your Speed is 0.

#### Emanation [Area of Effect]

An Emanation is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a creature or an object in all directions. The effect that creates an Emanation specifies the distance it extends.

An Emanation moves with the creature or object that is its origin unless it is an instantaneous or a stationary effect.

An Emanation's origin (creature or object) isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

#### Encounter

An encounter is a scene in an adventure that is part of at least one of the game's three pillars: social interaction, exploration, or combat. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Social Interaction," "Exploration," and "Combat").

#### Enemy

A creature is your enemy if it fights against you in combat, actively works to harm you, or is designated as your enemy by the rules or GM.

#### Exhaustion [Condition]

While you have the Exhaustion condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Exhaustion Levels._** This condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.

**_D20 Tests Affected._** When you make a D20 Test, the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.

**_Speed Reduced._** Your Speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.

**_Removing Exhaustion Levels._** Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.

#### Experience Points

As they overcome challenges and complete adventures, characters earn Experience Points (XP), which are awarded by the Game Master. When a character's XP total crosses certain thresholds, the character's level increases. *See also* "Level Advancement."

#### Expertise

Expertise is a feature that enhances your use of a skill proficiency. When you make an ability check with a skill proficiency in which you have Expertise, your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for that check unless the bonus is doubled by another feature.

If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one skill in which you have proficiency. You can't have Expertise in the same skill proficiency more than once.

*See also* "Playing the Game" ("Proficiency").

#### Falling [Hazard]

A creature that falls takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage at the end of the fall for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. When the creature lands, it has the Prone condition unless it avoids taking any damage from the fall.

A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its Reaction to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.

#### Flying

A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While flying, you fall if you have the Incapacitated or Prone condition or your Fly Speed is reduced to 0. You can stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover. *See also* "Falling" and "Fly Speed."

#### Fly Speed

A Fly Speed can be used to travel through the air. While you have a Fly Speed, you can stay aloft until you land, fall, or die. *See also* "Flying" and "Speed."

#### Friendly [Attitude]

A Friendly creature views you favorably. You have Advantage on an ability check to influence a Friendly creature. *See also* "Influence."

#### Frightened [Condition]

While you have the Frightened condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Ability Checks and Attacks Affected._** You have Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of fear is within line of sight.

**_Can't Approach._** You can't willingly move closer to the source of fear.

#### Grappled [Condition]

While you have the Grappled condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Speed 0._** Your Speed is 0 and can't increase.

**_Attacks Affected._** You have Disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than the grappler. 

**_Movable._** The grappler can drag or carry you when it moves, but every foot of movement costs it 1 extra foot unless you are Tiny or two or more sizes smaller than it.

#### Grappling

A creature can grapple another creature. Characters typically grapple by using an Unarmed Strike. Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. However a grapple is initiated, it follows these rules. *See also* "Unarmed Strike" and "Grappled."

**_Grappled Condition._** Successfully grappling a creature gives it the Grappled condition.

**_One Grapple per Hand._** A creature must have a hand free to grapple another creature. Some stat blocks and game effects allow a creature to grapple using a tentacle, a maw, or another body part. Whatever part a grappler uses, it can grapple only one creature at a time with that part, and the grappler can't use that part to target another creature unless it ends the grapple.

**_Ending a Grapple._** A Grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the grapple's escape DC, ending the condition on itself on a success. The condition also ends if the grappler has the Incapacitated condition or if the distance between the Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grapple's range. In addition, the grappler can release the target at any time (no action required).

#### Hazard

A hazard is an environmental danger. *See also* "Burning," "Dehydration," "Falling," "Malnutrition," and "Suffocation."

#### Healing

Healing is how you regain Hit Points. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Damage and Healing").

#### Heavily Obscured

You have the Blinded condition while trying to see something in a Heavily Obscured space. *See also* "Blinded," "Darkness," and "Playing the Game" ("Exploration").

#### Help [Action]

When you take the Help action, you do one of the following.

*Assist an Ability Check.* Choose one of your skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who is near enough for you to assist verbally or physically when they make an ability check. That ally has Advantage on the next ability check they make with the chosen skill or tool. This benefit expires if the ally doesn't use it before the start of your next turn. The GM has final say on whether your assistance is possible.

*Assist an Attack Roll.* You momentarily distract an enemy within 5 feet of you, giving Advantage to the next attack roll by one of your allies against that enemy. This benefit expires at the start of your next turn.

#### Heroic Inspiration

If you (a player character) have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll.

If you gain Heroic Inspiration but already have it, it's lost unless you give it to a player character who lacks it.

#### Hide [Action]

With the Hide action, you try to hide yourself. To do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check while you're Heavily Obscured or behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and you must be out of any enemy's line of sight; if you can see a creature, you can discern whether it can see you.

On a successful check, you have the Invisible condition while hidden. Make note of your check's total, which is the DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom (Perception) check.

You stop being hidden immediately after any of the following occurs: you make a sound louder than a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.

#### High Jump

When you make a High Jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 plus your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing High Jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot of the jump costs a foot of movement.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

#### Hit Point Dice

Hit Point Dice, or Hit Dice for short, help determine a player character's Hit Point maximum, as explained in "Character Creation." Most monsters also have Hit Dice. A creature can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to regain Hit Points. *See also* "Short Rest."

#### Hit Points

Hit Points (HP) are a measure of how difficult it is to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them. You can't have more Hit Points than your Hit Point maximum, and you can't have less than 0. *See also* "Breaking Objects" and "Playing the Game" ("Damage and Healing").

#### Hostile [Attitude]

A Hostile creature views you unfavorably. You have Disadvantage on an ability check to influence a Hostile creature. *See also* "Influence."

#### Hover

Some creatures can hover, as noted in their stat blocks, and some spells and other effects grant the ability to hover. Hovering while flying prevents you from falling in certain circumstances. *See also* "Flying."

#### Illusions

Spells and other effects sometimes create magical illusions. Such an effect defines what the illusion does and which senses or mental faculties it deceives.

If an illusion manifests in space, the illusion is insubstantial and weightless, yet it seems to be affected by the environment as if the illusion were real unless the effect that created it specifies otherwise. For example, a visual illusion of a creature casts shadows and reflections, and wind appears to affect the illusory creature. Similarly, an audible illusion echoes in an echoey space.

#### Immunity

If you have Immunity to a damage type or a condition, it doesn't affect you in any way.

#### Improvised Weapons

An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg, or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also counts as an improvised weapon if it's wielded in a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Melee weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An improvised weapon follows the rules below.

**_Proficiency._** Don't add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls with an improvised weapon.

**_Damage._** On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type the GM thinks is appropriate for the object.

**_Range._** If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

**_Weapon Equivalents._** If an improvised weapon resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the GM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon's rules. For example, the GM could treat a table leg as a Club.

#### Incapacitated [Condition]

While you have the Incapacitated condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Inactive._** You can't take any action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.

**_No Concentration._** Your Concentration is broken. *Speechless.* You can't speak.

**_Surprised._** If you're Incapacitated when you roll Initiative, you have Disadvantage on the roll.

#### Indifferent [Attitude]

An Indifferent creature has no desire to help or hinder you. Indifferent is the default attitude of a monster. *See also* "Influence."

#### Influence [Action]

With the Influence action, you urge a monster to do something. Describe or roleplay how you're communicating with the monster. Are you trying to deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The GM then determines whether the monster feels willing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction; this determination establishes whether an ability check is necessary, as explained below.

**_Willing._** If your urging aligns with the monster's desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster fulfills your request in a way it prefers.

**_Unwilling._** If your urging is repugnant to the monster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is necessary; it doesn't comply.

**_Hesitant._** If you urge the monster to do something that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability check, which is affected by the monster's attitude: Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile, each of which is defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks table suggests which ability check to make based on how you're interacting with the monster. The GM chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to 15 or the monster's Intelligence score, whichever is higher. On a successful check, the monster does as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours (or a duration set by the GM) before urging it in the same way again.

Table: Influence Checks

| Ability Check            | Interaction                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Charisma (Deception)     | Deceiving a monster that understands you     |
| Charisma (Intimidation)  | Intimidating a monster                       |
| Charisma (Performance)   | Amusing a monster                            |
| Charisma (Persuasion)    | Persuading a monster that understands you    |
| Wisdom (Animal Handling) | Gently coaxing a Beast or Monstrosity        |

#### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. The combat rules in "Playing the Game" explain how to roll Initiative.

Sometimes a GM might have combatants use their Initiative scores instead of rolling Initiative. Your Initiative score equals 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If you have Advantage on Initiative rolls, increase your Initiative score by 5. If you have Disadvantage on those rolls, decrease that score by 5. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Combat").

#### Invisible [Condition]

While you have the Invisible condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Surprise._** If you're Invisible when you roll Initiative, you have Advantage on the roll.

**_Concealed._** You aren't affected by any effect that requires its target to be seen unless the effect's creator can somehow see you. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is also concealed.

**_Attacks Affected._** Attack rolls against you have Disadvantage, and your attack rolls have Advantage. If a creature can somehow see you, you don't gain this benefit against that creature.

#### Jumping

When you jump, you make either a Long Jump (horizontal) or a High Jump (vertical). *See also* "Long Jump" and "High Jump."

#### Knocking Out a Creature

When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point. The creature then has the Unconscious condition and starts a Short Rest.

The creature remains Unconscious until it regains any Hit Points or until someone uses an action to administer first aid to it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

#### Lightly Obscured

You have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to see something in a Lightly Obscured space. *See also* "Dim Light" and "Playing the Game" ("Exploration").

#### Line [Area of Effect]

A Line is an area of effect that extends from a point of origin in a straight path along its length and covers an area defined by its width. The effect that creates a Line specifies its length and width.

A Line's point of origin isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

#### Long Jump

When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally a number of feet up to your Strength score if you

move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump. When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you jump costs a foot of movement.

If you land in Difficult Terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or have the Prone condition.

This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of the jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit the obstacle.

#### Long Rest

A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at least 8 hours—available to any creature. During a Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.

During sleep, you have the Unconscious condition. After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least 16 hours before starting another one.

**_Benefits of the Rest._** To start a Long Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point. When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:

**Regain All HP.** You regain all lost Hit Points and all spent Hit Point Dice. If your Hit Point maximum was reduced, it returns to normal.

**Ability Scores Restored.** If any of your ability scores were reduced, they return to normal.

**Exhaustion Reduced.** If you have the Exhaustion condition, its level decreases by 1.

**Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.

**_Interrupting the Rest._** A Long Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling Initiative
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage
- 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion

If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption, you gain the benefits of a Short Rest. *See also* "Short Rest."

You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish.

#### Magic [Action]

When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action or use a feature or magic item that requires a Magic action to be activated.

If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute or longer, you must take the Magic action on each turn of that casting, and you must maintain Concentration while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. *See also* "Concentration."

#### Magical Effect

An effect is magical if it is created by a spell, a magic item, or a phenomenon that a rule labels as magical.

#### Malnutrition [Hazard]

A creature needs an amount of food per day based on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day table. A creature that eats but consumes less than half the required food for a day must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level at the day's end. A creature that eats nothing for 5 days automatically gains 1 Exhaustion level at the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level at the end of each subsequent day without food.

Exhaustion caused by malnutrition can't be removed until the creature eats the full amount of food required for a day. *See also* "Exhaustion."

Table: Food Needs per Day

| Size       | Food      |
|------------|-----------|
| Tiny       | 1/4 pound |
| Small      | 1 pound   |
| Medium     | 1 pound   |
| Large      | 4 pounds  |
| Huge       | 16 pounds |
| Gargantuan | 64 pounds |

#### Monster

A monster is a creature controlled by the GM, even if the creature is benevolent. *See also* "Creature" and "NPC."

#### Nonplayer Character

A nonplayer character (NPC) is a monster that has a personal name and a distinct personality. *See also* "Monster."

#### Object

An object is a nonliving, distinct thing. Composite things, like buildings, comprise more than one object. *See also* "Breaking Objects."

#### Occupied Space

A space is occupied if a creature is in it or if it is completely filled by objects.

#### Opportunity Attacks

You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach using its action, its Bonus Action, its Reaction, or one of its speeds. To make the Opportunity Attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Combat").

#### Paralyzed [Condition]

While you have the Paralyzed condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Incapacitated._** You have the Incapacitated condition.

**_Speed 0._** Your Speed is 0 and can't increase. *Saving Throws Affected.* You automatically fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

**_Attacks Affected._** Attack rolls against you have Advantage.

**_Automatic Critical Hits._** Any attack roll that hits you is a Critical Hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of you.

#### Passive Perception

Passive Perception is a score that reflects a creature's general awareness of its surroundings. The GM uses this score when determining whether a creature notices something without consciously making a Wisdom (Perception) check.

A creature's Passive Perception equals 10 plus the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check bonus. If the creature has Advantage on such checks, increase the score by 5. If the creature has Disadvantage on them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level 1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 + 2). If that character has Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, the score becomes 19.

#### Per Day

If a rule says you can use something a certain number of times per day, that means you must finish a Long Rest to use it again after you run out of uses.

#### Petrified [Condition]

While you have the Petrified condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Turned to Inanimate Substance._** You are transformed, along with any nonmagical objects you are wearing and carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Your weight increases by a factor of ten, and you cease aging.

**_Incapacitated._** You have the Incapacitated condition.

**_Speed 0._** Your Speed is 0 and can't increase. *Attacks Affected.* Attack rolls against you have Advantage.

**_Saving Throws Affected._** You automatically fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

**_Resist Damage._** You have Resistance to all damage.

**_Poison Immunity._** You have Immunity to the Poisoned condition.

#### Player Character

A player character is a character controlled by a player. *See also* "Character Creation."

#### Poisoned [Condition]

While you have the Poisoned condition, you experience the following effect.

**_Ability Checks and Attacks Affected._** You have Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

#### Possession

Some effects cause a creature to be possessed by another creature or entity. A possessing effect defines how the possession operates. Possession can be prevented by the *Protection from Evil and Good* spell and ended by the *Dispel Evil and Good* spell.

#### Proficiency

If you have proficiency with something, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any D20 Test you make using that thing. A creature might have proficiency in a skill or saving throw or with a weapon or tool. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Proficiency").

#### Prone [Condition]

While you have the Prone condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Restricted Movement._** Your only movement options are to crawl or to spend an amount of movement equal to half your Speed (round down) to right yourself and thereby end the condition. If your Speed is 0, you can't right yourself.

**_Attacks Affected._** You have Disadvantage on attack rolls. An attack roll against you has Advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of you. Otherwise, that attack roll has Disadvantage.

#### Reach

A creature has a reach of 5 feet unless a rule says otherwise.

#### Reaction

A Reaction is a special action taken in response to a trigger defined in the Reaction's description. You can take a Reaction on another creature's turn, and if you take it on your turn, you can do so even if you also take an action, a Bonus Action, or both. Once you take a Reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. The Opportunity Attack is a Reaction available to all creatures. *See also* "Opportunity Attacks" and "Playing the Game" ("Actions").

#### Ready [Action]

You take the Ready action to wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a Reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your Speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the zombie steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your Reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.

When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (expending any resources used to cast it) but hold its energy, which you release with your Reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an action, and holding on to the spell's magic requires Concentration, which you can maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.

#### Resistance

If you have Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against you (round down). Resistance is applied only once to an instance of damage. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Damage and Healing").

#### Restrained [Condition]

While you have the Restrained condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Speed 0._** Your Speed is 0 and can't increase. 

**_Attacks Affected._** Attack rolls against you have Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage. 

**_Saving Throws Affected._** You have Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

#### Ritual

If you have a spell prepared that has the Ritual tag, you can cast that spell as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level. *See also* "Spells."

#### Round Down

Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make an exception and tell you to round up.

#### Save

Save is another name for a saving throw. *See also* "Saving Throw."

#### Saving Throw

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to avoid or resist a threat. You normally make a saving throw only when a rule requires you to do so, but you can decide to fail the save without rolling. The result of a save is detailed in the effect that allowed it. If a target is forced to make a save and lacks the ability score used by it, the target automatically fails. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("D20 Tests").

#### Search [Action]

When you take the Search action, you make a Wisdom check to discern something that isn't obvious. The Search table suggests which skills are applicable when you take this action, depending on what you're trying to detect.

Table: Search

| Skill      | Thing to Detect                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Insight    | Creature's state of mind             |
| Medicine   | Creature's ailment or cause of death |
| Perception | Concealed creature or object         |
| Survival   | Tracks or food                       |

#### Shape-Shifting

If an effect, such as Wild Shape or the *Polymorph* spell, lets you shape-shift, its description specifies what happens to you. Unless that description says otherwise, any ongoing effects on you—conditions, spells, curses, and the like—carry over from one form to the other. You revert to your true form if you die.

#### Short Rest

A Short Rest is a 1-hour period of downtime, during which a creature does nothing more strenuous than reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start a Short Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point.

**Benefits of the Rest.** When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:

**Spend Hit Point Dice.** You can spend one or more of your Hit Point Dice to regain Hit Points. For each Hit Point Die you spend in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain Hit Points equal to the total (minimum of 1 Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional Hit Point Die after each roll.

**Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.

**_Interrupting the Rest._** A Short Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling Initiative
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage

An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits.

#### Simultaneous Effects

If two or more things happen at the same time on a turn, the person at the game table—player or GM whose turn it is decides the order in which those things happen. For example, if two effects occur at the start of a player character's turn, the player decides which of the effects happens first.

#### Size

A creature or an object belongs to a size category: Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. A creature's size determines how much space the creature occupies in combat. An object's size affects its Hit Points. *See also* "Breaking Objects" and "Playing the Game" ("Combat").

#### Skill

A skill is an area of specialization associated with an ability check. If you have proficiency in a skill, you can add your Proficiency Bonus when you make an ability check associated with that skill. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Proficiency").

#### Speed

A creature has a Speed, which is the distance in feet the creature can cover when it moves on its turn. *See also* "Climbing," "Crawling," "Flying," "Jumping," "Swimming" and "Playing the Game" ("Combat").

**_Special Speeds._** Some creatures have special speeds, such as a Burrow Speed, Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed, each of which is defined in this glossary. If you have more than one speed, choose which one to use when you move; you can switch between the speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 and a Fly Speed of 40, you could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet, and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more.

**_Changes to Your Speeds._** If an effect increases or decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed you have increases or decreases by an equal amount for the same duration. For example, if your Speed is reduced to 0 and you have a Climb Speed, your Climb Speed is also reduced to 0. Similarly, if your Speed is halved and you have a Fly Speed, your Fly Speed is also halved.

#### Spell

A spell is a magical effect that has the characteristics described in "Spells."

#### Spell Attack

A spell attack is an attack roll made as part of a spell or another magical effect. *See also* "Spells" ("Casting Spells").

#### Spellcasting Focus

A Spellcasting Focus is an object that certain creatures can use in place of a spell's Material components if those materials aren't consumed by the spell and don't have a cost specified. Some classes allow its members to use certain types of Spellcasting Focuses. *See also* "Spells" ("Casting Spells").

#### Sphere [Area of Effect]

A Sphere is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin outward in all directions. The effect that creates a Sphere specifies the distance it extends as the radius of the Sphere.

A Sphere's point of origin is included in the Sphere's area of effect.

#### Stable

A creature is Stable if it has 0 Hit Points but isn't required to make Death Saving Throws. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Damage and Healing").

#### Stat Block

A stat block contains the game statistics of a monster. Each stat block includes the following information presented after the monster's name.

**_Reactions._** If the monster can take special Reactions, those are listed in this section.

**_Attack Notation._** The entry for a monster's attack starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says otherwise.

**_Saving Throw Effect Notation._** If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect's entry starts by identifying the kind of saving throw required and then provides the save's DC, a description of which creatures must make the save, and what happens on a failed or a successful save.

**_Damage Notation._** A stat block usually provides both a static number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. The GM determines whether you use the static number or the die expression in parentheses; you don't use both.

#### Study [Action]

When you take the Study action, you make an Intelligence check to study your memory, a book, a clue, or another source of knowledge and call to mind an important piece of information about it.

The Areas of Knowledge table suggests which skills are applicable to various areas of knowledge.

#### **Areas of Knowledge**

| Skill         | Areas                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Arcana        | Spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, planes of existence, and certain creatures (Aberrations, Constructs, Elementals, Fey, and Monstrosities)  |
| History       | Historic events and people, ancient civilizations, wars, and certain creatures (Giants and Humanoids)                                                                     |
| Investigation | Traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry                                                                                                                                           |
| Nature        | Terrain, flora, weather, and certain creatures (Beasts, Dragons, Oozes, and Plants)                                                                                       |
| Religion      | Deities, religious hierarchies and rites, holy symbols, cults, and certain crea tures (Celestials, Fiends, and Undead)                                                    |

#### Stunned [Condition]

While you have the Stunned condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Incapacitated._** You have the Incapacitated condition.

**_Saving Throws Affected._** You automatically fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

**_Attacks Affected._** Attack rolls against you have Advantage.

#### Suffocation [Hazard]

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 plus its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds) before suffocation begins. When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it gains 1 Exhaustion level at the end of each of its turns. When a creature can breathe again, it removes all levels of Exhaustion it gained from suffocating.

#### Surprise

If a creature is caught unawares by the start of combat, that creature is surprised, which causes it to have Disadvantage on its Initiative roll. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Combat").

#### Swimming

While you're swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). You ignore this extra cost if you have a Swim Speed and use it to swim. At the GM's option, moving any distance in rough water might require a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Swim Speed

A Swim Speed can be used to swim without expending the extra movement normally associated with swimming. *See also* "Swimming" and "Speed."

#### Target

A target is the creature or object targeted by an attack roll, forced to make a saving throw by an effect, or selected to receive the effects of a spell or another phenomenon.

#### Telepathy

Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. Unless a rule states otherwise, the contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with the telepath to understand this communication, but the contacted creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself to understand.

A telepath doesn't need to see a contacted creature, and the telepath can start or end the telepathic contact at any time (no action required). Telepathic contact can't be initiated and is immediately broken if either the telepath or the other creature has the Incapacitated condition. Telepathic contact is also broken if the contacted creature is no longer within the telepathy's range or if the telepath contacts a different creature within range.

A creature without telepathy can receive telepathic messages but can't initiate a telepathic conversation. Once a telepathic conversation starts, the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the telepath until the telepathic connection ends.

#### Teleportation

Teleportation is a special kind of magical transportation. If you teleport, you disappear and reappear elsewhere instantly, without moving through the intervening space. This transportation doesn't expend movement unless a rule tells you otherwise, and teleportation never provokes Opportunity Attacks.

When you teleport, all the equipment you're wearing and carrying teleports with you. If you're touching another creature when you teleport, that creature doesn't teleport with you unless the teleportation effect says otherwise.

If the destination space of your teleportation is occupied by another creature or blocked by a solid obstacle, you instead appear in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.

The description of a teleportation effect tells you if you must see the teleportation's destination.

#### Temporary Hit Points

Temporary Hit Points are granted by certain effects and act as a buffer against losing real Hit Points. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Damage and Healing").

#### Tremorsense

A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it is detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.

Tremorsense can't detect creatures or objects in the air, and it doesn't count as a form of sight.

#### Truesight

If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced within a specified range. Within that range, your vision pierces through the following:

**Darkness.** You can see in normal and magical Darkness.

**Invisibility.** You see creatures and objects that have the Invisible condition.

**Visual Illusions.** Visual illusions appear transparent to you, and you automatically succeed on saving throws against them.

**Transformations.** You discern the true form of any creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic.

**Ethereal Plane.** You see into the Ethereal Plane.

#### Unarmed Strike

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, you can use a punch, kick, headbutt, or similar forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed Strike—a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5 feet of you.

Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose one of the following options for its effect.

**_Damage._** You make an attack roll against the target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus your Strength modifier.

**_Grapple._** The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it has the Grappled condition. The DC for the saving throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab it. *See also* "Grappling."

**_Shove._** The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone condition. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you.

#### Unconscious [Condition]

While you have the Unconscious condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Inert._** You have the Incapacitated and Prone conditions, and you drop whatever you're holding. When this condition ends, you remain Prone.

**_Speed 0._** Your Speed is 0 and can't increase.

**_Attacks Affected._** Attack rolls against you have Advantage.

**_Saving Throws Affected._** You automatically fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

**_Automatic Critical Hits._** Any attack roll that hits you is a Critical Hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of you.

**_Unaware._** You're unaware of your surroundings.

#### Unoccupied Space

A space is unoccupied if no creatures are in it and it isn't completely filled by objects.

#### Utilize [Action]

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of the Attack action. When an object requires an action for its use, you take the Utilize action.

#### Vulnerability

If you have Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against you. Vulnerability is applied only once to an instance of damage. *See also* "Playing the Game" ("Damage and Healing").

#### Weapon

A weapon is an object that is in the Simple or Martial weapon category. *See also* "Equipment" ("Weapons").

#### Weapon Attack

A weapon attack is an attack roll made with a weapon. *See also* "Weapon."

# Gameplay Toolbox

## Travel Pace

A group of characters can travel overland at a Normal, Fast, or Slow pace, as described in "Playing the Game." During any journey stage, the predominant terrain determines the characters' maximum travel pace, as shown in the Maximum Pace column of the Travel Terrain table. Certain factors can affect a group's travel pace.

### Good Roads

The presence of a good road increases the group's maximum pace by one step (from Slow to Normal or from Normal to Fast).

### Slower Travelers

The group must move at a Slow pace if any group member's Speed is reduced to half or less of normal.

### Extended Travel

Characters can push themselves to travel for more than 8 hours per day, at the risk of tiring. At the end of each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, each character must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 10 plus 1 for each hour past 8 hours.

### Special Movement

If a party can travel at a high Speed for an extended time, as with a spell such as *Wind Walk* or a magic item such as a *Carpet of Flying*, translate the party's Speed into travel rates using these rules:

**Miles per hour** = Speed ÷ 10 

**Miles per day** (Normal pace) = Miles per hour × number of hours traveled (typically 8) 

**Fast pace** = Miles per day × 1⅓ (round down) 

**Slow pace** = Miles per day × 2/3 (round down)

If the characters are flying or their special movement allows them to ignore Difficult Terrain, they can move at a Fast pace regardless of the terrain.

### Vehicles

Characters traveling in a vehicle use the vehicle's speed in miles per hour (as shown in "Equipment") to determine their rate of travel, and they don't choose a travel pace.

## Creating a Background

A character's background represents what the character did prior to becoming an adventurer. Creating a unique background or customizing an existing one can reflect the particular theme of your campaign or elements of your world. You can also create a background to help a player craft the story they have in mind for their character.

This section describes, step by step, how you can create backgrounds tailored for your world and the heroes in it.

### 1: Choose Abilities

Choose three abilities that seem appropriate for the background:

**Strength or Dexterity.** These abilities are ideal for a background involving physical exertion.

**Constitution.** This ability is ideal for a background that involves endurance or long hours of activity.

**Intelligence or Wisdom.** One or both abilities are ideal for a background that focuses on cerebral or spiritual matters.

**Charisma.** This ability is ideal for a background that involves performance or social interaction.

Table: Travel Terrain

| Terrain    | Maximum Pace | Encounter Distance | Foraging DC | Navigation DC | Search DC |
|------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Arctic     | Fast*        | 6d6 × 10 feet      | 20          | 10            | 10        |
| Coastal    | Normal       | 2d10 × 10 feet     | 10          | 5             | 15        |
| Desert     | Normal       | 6d6 × 10 feet      | 20          | 10            | 10        |
| Forest     | Normal       | 2d8 × 10 feet      | 10          | 15            | 15        |
| Grassland  | Fast         | 6d6 × 10 feet      | 15          | 5             | 15        |
| Hill       | Normal       | 2d10 × 10 feet     | 15          | 10            | 15        |
| Mountain   | Slow         | 4d10 × 10 feet     | 20          | 15            | 20        |
| Swamp      | Slow         | 2d8 × 10 feet      | 10          | 15            | 20        |
| Underdark  | Normal       | 2d6 × 10 feet      | 20          | 10            | 20        |
| Urban      | Normal       | 2d6 × 10 feet      | 20          | 15            | 15        |
| Waterborne | Special†     | 6d6 × 10 feet      | 15          | 10            | 15        |

\*Appropriate equipment (such as skis) is necessary to keep up a Fast pace in Arctic terrain. 

† Characters' rate of travel while waterborne depends on the vehicle carrying them; see "Vehicles."

### 2: Choose a Feat

Choose one feat from the Origin category. See "Origin Feats" for examples of Origin feats.

### 3: Choose Skill Proficiencies

Choose two skills appropriate for the background. There needn't be a relationship between the skill proficiencies a background grants and the ability scores it increases.

### 4: Choose a Tool Proficiency

Choose one tool used in the practice of the background or often associated with it.

### 5: Choose Equipment

Assemble a package of equipment worth 50 GP (including unspent gold). Don't include Martial weapons or armor, as characters get them from their class choices.

## Curses and Magical Contagions

A curse is a magical burden that lasts for a specified time or until it is ended by some means. A magical contagion is an adverse effect of magical origin that is contagious by definition.

The following sections discuss curses and magical contagions in detail.

### Curses

A curse typically takes one of the forms detailed below.

#### Bestow Curse

The simplest curses are created by the *Bestow Curse* spell. The effects of such curses are limited and can be ended by the *Remove Curse* spell.

*Bestow Curse* provides useful benchmarks for gauging the potency of other curses. A curse that lasts for 1 minute equates to a level 3 spell, while one that lasts until dispelled equates to a level 9 spell.

#### Cursed Creatures

Some monsters are associated with curses, whether as part of their origins or due to their ability to spread curses—werewolves being a prime example.

You decide how a spell like *Remove Curse* affects a creature with accursed origins. For example, you might decide that a mummy was created through a curse and it can be destroyed permanently only by casting *Remove Curse* on its corpse.

#### Cursed Magic Items

Cursed magic items are created deliberately or originate as the result of supernatural events. Such items are detailed in "Magic Items."

#### Narrative Curses

A curse might manifest during an adventure when a creature's violation of a taboo warrants supernatural punishment, such as breaking a vow, defiling a tomb, or murdering an innocent. Such a curse can have any effects you design, or it might be a customized version of another type of curse discussed in this section.

A creature affected by such a curse should know why they're being punished and be able to learn how to end their curse, likely by symbolically righting the wrong they committed. How a spell like *Remove Curse* affects a curse that's part of your adventure is up to you—the spell might merely suppress the effects of the curse for a time. Regardless, narrative curses should feel like rare, potent magic rooted in the lore of your campaign.

#### Environmental Curses

Some locations are so suffused with evil that anyone who lingers there is burdened with a curse. Demonic Possession is one example of an environmental curse.

**Demonic Possession.** Demonic Possession arises from the chaos and evil of the Abyss and commonly besets creatures that interact with demonic objects or linger in desecrated locations, where demonic spirits await victims.

A creature that becomes the target of Demonic Possession must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by a bodiless demonic entity. Whenever the possessed creature rolls a 1 on a D20 Test, the demonic entity takes control of the creature and determines the creature's behavior thereafter. At the end of each of the possessed creature's later turns, the creature makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, regaining control of itself on a success.

After finishing a Long Rest, a creature with Demonic Possession makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on the creature. A *Dispel Evil and Good* spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the effect on it.

### Magical Contagions

Alchemists, potion brewers, and areas of wild magic are credited with creating the first magical contagions. An outbreak of such a contagion can form the basis of an adventure as characters search for a cure and try to stop the contagion's spread.

#### Rest and Recuperation

If a creature infected with a magical contagion spends 3 days recuperating—engaging in no activities that would interrupt a Long Rest—the creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of the recuperation period. On a successful save, the creature has Advantage on saving throws to fight off the magical contagion for the next 24 hours.

#### Example Contagions

The following examples show how magical contagions can work. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, effects, and other characteristics of these contagions to suit your campaign.

#### Cackle Fever

*Magical Contagion*

Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids only (gnomes are strangely immune). A creature suffers the following effects 1d4 days after infection:

**Fever.** The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level, which lasts until the contagion ends on the creature.

**Uncontrollable Laughter.** While the creature has the Exhaustion condition, the creature makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each time it takes damage other than Psychic damage. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) Psychic damage and has the Incapacitated condition as it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.

**_Fighting the Contagion._** At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. After the creature succeeds on three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year.

**_Spreading the Contagion._** Any Humanoid (other than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot Emanation originating from a creature infected with Cackle Fever must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.

#### Sewer Plague

*Magical Contagion*

Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and refuse heaps and is sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in such areas, including otyughs and rats. Any Humanoid that is wounded by a creature that carries the contagion or that comes into contact with contaminated filth or offal must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers the following effects 1d4 days after infection:

**Fatigue.** The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level. 

**Weakness.** While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, it regains only half the normal number of Hit Points from spending Hit Point Dice. 

**Restlessness.** While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither restores lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature's Exhaustion level.

**_Fighting the Contagion._** Daily at dawn, an infected creature makes a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 Exhaustion level as its fatigue worsens. On a successful save, the creature's Exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the creature's Exhaustion level is reduced to 0, the contagion ends on the creature.

#### Sight Rot

*Magical Contagion*

Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted by Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition until the contagion ends.

**_Fighting the Contagion._** Magic such as a *Heal* or *Lesser Restoration* spell ends the contagion immediately. A character who is proficient with an Herbalism Kit can use it to create one dose of nonmagical ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the ointment suppresses the contagion on that creature for 24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on the creature.

**_Spreading the Contagion._** Any Humanoid that makes skin contact with a creature infected with Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.

## Environmental Effects 

### Deep Water

Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet deep) presents additional challenges because of the water's pressure and cold temperature. After each hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level.

### Extreme Cold

When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 Exhaustion level. Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save.

### Extreme Heat

When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have Disadvantage on the save. Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Fire damage automatically succeed on the save.

### Frigid Water

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. Creatures with Resistance or Immunity to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.

### Heavy Precipitation

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is Lightly Obscured, and creatures in the area have Disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.

### High Altitude

Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for most creatures because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel (see "Travel Pace").

Creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Creatures can't become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such environments.

### Slippery Ice

Slippery ice is Difficult Terrain. A creature that moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.

### Strong Wind

Strong wind imposes Disadvantage on ranged attack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

### Thin Ice

Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through. Below the ice is frigid water (see "Frigid Water" above).

## Fear and Mental Stress

Due to the nature of their vocation, adventurers tend to be less susceptible to fear and mental stress than common folk. Whereas a farmer might flee in terror from a bear or an apparition, adventurers are made of sterner stuff. That said, certain creatures and game effects can terrify or fray the mind of even the most stalwart adventurer.

If you plan to use any of these rules, discuss them with your players at the start of the campaign.

### Fear Effects

Whenever the characters encounter something that is supernaturally frightful, use the Frightened condition as the baseline effect. Fear effects typically require a Wisdom saving throw, with a save DC based on how terrifying the situation is. The Sample Fear DCs table provides some examples.

Table: Sample Fear DCs

| Example                                                                                                                                     | Save DC |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| When the characters open a sarcophagus, a harmless yet terrifying apparition appears.                                                       | 10      |
| A character triggers a magical trap that creates an illusory manifestation of that character's worst fears, visible only to that character. | 15      |
| A portal to the Abyss opens, revealing a nightmarish realm of torment and slaughter.                                                        | 20      |

Typically, a Frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

At your discretion, a Frightened creature might be subject to other effects as long as the Frightened condition lasts. Consider these examples:

- The Frightened creature must take the Dash action on each of its turns and uses its movement to get farther away from the source of its fear.
- Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have Advantage.
- The Frightened creature can do only one of the following on each of its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

### Mental Stress Effects

When a character is subjected to an effect that causes intense mental stress, Psychic damage is the best way to emulate that effect.

The Sample Mental Stress Effects table provides a few examples of such effects, with suggested saving throw DCs and damage. Mental stress can usually be resisted with a successful Wisdom save, but sometimes an Intelligence or Charisma save is more appropriate. On a successful save, a character might take half as much damage instead of no damage, at your discretion.

Table: Sample Mental Stress Effects

| Example                                                                                              | Save DC | Psychic Damage |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|
| A character ingests a hallucinogenic substance that distorts the charac ter's perception of reality. | 10      | 1d6            |
| A character touches a fiendish idol that tears at the character's mind, threatening to shatter it.   | 15      | 3d6            |
| A magical trap flings a character into the Far Realm until the end of that character's next turn.    | 20      | 9d6            |

#### Prolonged Effects

Exposure to mental stress can cause prolonged effects. Consider the following possibilities.

**_Short-Term Effects._** The character has the Frightened, Incapacitated, or Stunned condition for 1d10 minutes. This condition might be accompanied by alarming behavior or hallucinations. These effects can be suppressed with the *Calm Emotions* spell or removed by the *Lesser Restoration* spell.

**_Long-Term Effects._** The character has Disadvantage on some or all ability checks for 1d10 × 10 hours, stemming from an unwillingness or inability to exert a particular set of abilities. The character might feel enervated and unable to exert much Strength, for example, or become so suspicious of others that Charisma checks are more difficult. These effects can be suppressed with the *Calm Emotions* spell or removed by the *Lesser Restoration* spell.

**_Indefinite Effects._** An indefinite effect is a longterm effect (see above) that lasts until removed by a *Greater Restoration* spell. It can be suppressed by a *Calm Emotions* spell.

## Poison

Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures. Poisons come in the following four types:

**Contact.** Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

**Ingested.** A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half as much damage on a failed save.

**Inhaled.** Poisonous powders and gases take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

**Injury.** Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or similar object. The poison remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

### Purchasing Poison

In some settings, laws prohibit the possession and use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poison easily. Other characters might have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire the poison they seek.

### Harvesting Poison

A character can attempt to harvest poison from a venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapacitated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after which the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check using a Poisoner's Kit. On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose, and no additional poison can be harvested from that creature. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison.

### Sample Poisons

Example poisons are detailed here in alphabetical order. Each poison's description includes the suggested price for a single dose of the poison, its type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury), and a description of the poison's debilitating effects.

#### Assassin's Blood (150 GP)

*Ingested Poison*

A creature subjected to Assassin's Blood makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6 (1d12) Poison damage and has the Poisoned condition for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

#### Burnt Othur Fumes (500 GP)

*Inhaled Poison*

A creature subjected to Burnt Othur Fumes must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) Poison damage, and it must repeat the save at the start of each of its turns.

## Traps

Traps should be used sparingly, lest they lose their charm. A hidden pit can be a fun surprise, but too many traps in an adventure can lead players to become overly cautious, which slows down the game.

The best traps are fleeting distractions that skilled characters can overcome in a short amount of time or deadly puzzles that require quick thinking and teamwork to overcome. Traps that are undetectable and inescapable are rarely fun.

### Parts of a Trap

The description of a trap includes the following parts after the trap's name:

**Severity and Levels.** A trap is designated as a nuisance or as deadly for characters of certain levels. A nuisance trap is unlikely to seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a deadly trap can grievously damage characters of the indicated levels.

**Trigger.** Traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Examples of triggers include stepping on a pressure plate, crossing a trip wire, turning a doorknob, or using the wrong key in a lock.

**Duration.** Some traps have durations expressed in rounds, minutes, or hours. Others specify that their effects last until the trap is destroyed or dispelled. If a trap's duration is instantaneous, its effect is resolved instantly. If a trap resets after activating, that fact is noted in this entry. A trap is otherwise inert after activation.

Use caution when introducing a trap to characters of a level lower than the trap's level range. A trap that is a nuisance at one level range could be deadly to characters of a lower level range.

### Example Traps

Traps are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Collapsing Roof

*Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)*

**Trigger:** A creature crosses a trip wire 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This trap uses a trip wire to collapse an unstable section of ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two weak supports that topple when the trip wire is pulled.

The first creature that crosses the trip wire causes the supports to topple and the unstable section of ceiling to collapse. Each creature beneath the unstable section of ceiling must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Rubble from the collapse turns the trapped area into Difficult Terrain.

**_Detect and Disarm._** As a Search action, a creature can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire and the unstable section of ceiling on a successful check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided (no ability check required).

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Bludgeoning Damage | Save DC |
|--------|--------------------|---------|
| 5–10   | 22 (4d10)          | 15      |
| 11–16  | 55 (10d10)         | 17      |
| 17–20  | 99 (18d10)         | 19      |

#### Falling Net

*Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)*

**Trigger:** A creature crosses a trip wire 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A falling net trap uses a trip wire to release a weighted, 10-foot-square Net suspended from the ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees.

The first creature that crosses the trip wire causes the Net to fall on it. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition until it escapes. The target succeeds automatically if it's Huge or larger. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from the Net on a successful check.

**_Detect and Disarm._** As a Search action, a creature can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire and the suspended Net on a successful check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided (no ability check required).

**_Destroy the Net._** Reducing the Net to 0 Hit Points frees any creature trapped in it (see "Adventuring Gear" for the Net's statistics).

**_Set the Trap._** A creature that has Thieves' Tools and all the trap's components (including a Net) can try to set a falling net trap, doing so with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Each attempt to set this trap takes 10 minutes.

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the weight of the Net, which increases the save DC and the DC of the Strength (Athletics) check as follows: DC 12 at levels 5–10, DC 14 at levels 11–16, or DC 16 at levels 17–20.

#### Fire-Casting Statue

*Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)*

**Trigger:** A creature moves onto a pressure plate

**Duration:** Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the start of the next turn

When a creature moves onto this trap's pressure plate for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, a nearby statue exhales a 15-foot Cone of magical flame. The statue can look like anything, such as a dragon or a wizard. Each creature in the Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Detect and Disarm._** A *Detect Magic* spell reveals an aura of Evocation magic around the statue. As a Search action, a creature within 5 feet of the statue can examine it and make a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting a tiny glyph on the statue on a successful check. Once the glyph is found, a character can take a Study action to examine it and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, ascertaining that the glyph means "fire" on a successful check. As an action, a character can use a sharp tool to deface the glyph, which disarms the trap.

As a Search action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging an Iron Spike or similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering.

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the damage and the area of effect, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Fire Damage | Area of Effect | 
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 5–10   | 22 (4d10)   | 30-foot Cone   |
| 11–16  | 55 (10d10)  | 60-foot Cone   |
| 17–20  | 99 (18d10)  | 120-foot Cone  |

#### Hidden Pit

*Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)*

**Trigger:** A creature moves onto the pit's lid 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed from material identical to the surrounding floor. When a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the pit. The lid remains open thereafter.

A creature that falls into the pit takes 3 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage from the fall.

**_Detect and Disarm._** As a Study action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pit's lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, detecting the pit on a successful check. Once the pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar object can be wedged between the pit's lid and the surrounding floor to prevent the lid from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be held shut using *Arcane Lock* or similar magic.

**_Escape._** A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing gear, or magic such as *Spider Climb* to scale the pit's smooth walls. You can make the pit easier to escape by adding cracks in the walls big enough to serve as handholds and footholds.

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the pit's depth and damage, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Pit Depth | Bludgeoning Damage |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|
| 5–10   | 30 feet   | 10 (3d6)           |
| 11–16  | 60 feet   | 21 (6d6)           |
| 17–20  | 120 feet  | 42 (12d6)          |

#### Poisoned Darts

*Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)*

**Trigger:** A creature moves onto a pressure plate 

**Duration:** Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the start of the next turn if it has activated fewer than three times

When a creature moves onto this trap's pressure plate for the first time on a turn, poisoned darts shoot from tubes embedded in the surrounding walls. The holes that house these tubes are obscured by dust and cobwebs or skillfully hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes.

Each creature in the darts' path must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by 1d3 darts, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage per dart.

**_Detect and Disarm._** As a Search action, a creature can examine the walls and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the holes on a successful check. Plugging all the holes with wax, cloth, or detritus prevents the darts from firing.

As a Search action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering.

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing each dart's Poison damage as follows: 7 (2d6) at levels 5–10, 14 (4d6) at levels 11–16, or 24 (7d6) at levels 17–20.

#### Poisoned Needle

*Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)*

**Trigger:** A creature opens the trap's lock improperly or fails to disarm the trap 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A poisoned needle is hidden in a lock. When a creature opens the lock with any object other than the proper key, the needle springs out and stabs the creature. The creature makes a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) Poison damage and has the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

**_Avoid._** The trap doesn't trigger if the lock is opened using a *Knock* spell or similar magic.

**_Detect and Disarm._** As a Search action, a creature can examine the trapped lock and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the needle on a successful check. Once the trap is detected, a character can take an action to try to disarm the trap, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a failed check, the creature triggers the trap.

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Poison Damage | Save DC |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| 5–10   | 11 (2d10)     | 13      |
| 11–16  | 22 (4d10)     | 15      |
| 17–20  | 55 (10d10)    | 17      |

#### Rolling Stone

*Deadly Trap (Levels 11–16) or Nuisance Trap (Levels 17–20)*

**Trigger:** A creature moves onto a pressure plate 

**Duration:** Until the stone stops rolling

When a creature moves onto a hidden pressure plate, a 5-foot-radius orb of solid stone is released from a secret compartment and begins to roll. The stone and all creatures nearby roll Initiative; the stone gets a +8 bonus on its Initiative roll.

On its turn, the stone moves 60 feet in one direction, changing course if redirected by an obstacle. The stone can move through creatures' spaces, and creatures can move through the stone's space, treating it as Difficult Terrain. Whenever the stone enters a creature's space for the first time on a turn or a creature enters the stone's space while the stone is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition.

The stone stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can't go around corners, but creative dungeon builders incorporate curving turns into nearby passages that allow the stone to keep moving.

**_Detect and Disarm._** As a Study action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, deducing the pressure plate's function on a successful check. Wedging an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering.

**_Destroy the Stone._** The stone is a Large object that has AC 17, HP 100, a Damage Threshold of 10, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.

**_Slow the Stone._** As an action, a creature can try to slow down the stone with a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check is successful, the distance the stone moves on its turn is reduced by 15 feet. If that distance drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.

#### Spiked Pit

*Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)*

**Trigger:** A creature moves onto the pit's lid 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed from material identical to the surrounding floor. When a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the pit, which has sharpened wooden or metal spikes at the bottom. The lid remains open thereafter.

A creature that falls into the pit lands at the bottom and takes 3 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage from the fall plus 9 (2d8) Piercing damage from the spikes.

**_Detect and Disarm._** As a Study action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pit's lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, detecting the pit on a successful check. Once the hidden pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar object can be wedged between the pit's lid and the surrounding floor to prevent the lid from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be held shut using an *Arcane Lock* spell or similar magic.

**_Escape._** A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing gear, or magic such as a *Spider Climb* spell to scale the pit's smooth walls. You can make the pit easier to escape by adding cracks in the walls big enough to serve as handholds and footholds.

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the pit's depth and damage, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Pit Depth | Damage                                        |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 5–10   | 30 feet   | 10 (3d6) Bludgeoning plus 13 (3d8) Piercing   |
| 11–16  | 60 feet   | 21 (6d6) Bludgeoning plus 36 (8d8) Piercing   |
| 17–20  | 120 feet  | 42 (12d6) Bludgeoning plus 57 (13d8) Piercing |

## Combat Encounters

The following features can make a combat encounter more interesting or challenging:

**Changes in Elevation.** Terrain features that provide a change of elevation (such as stacks of empty crates, ledges, and balconies) reward clever positioning and encourage characters to jump, climb, fly, or teleport.

**Defensive Positions.** Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive positions force characters who normally attack at range to move around.

**Mixed Monster Groups.** When different types of monsters work together, they can combine their abilities—just like characters with different classes and origins. A diverse force is more powerful.

**Reasons to Move.** Use features that encourage characters and their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers, kegs of gunpowder or oil, and rolling stone traps.

### Combat Encounter Difficulty

Use the following guidelines to create a combat encounter of a desired level of difficulty.

#### Step 1: Choose a Difficulty

Three categories describe the range of encounter difficulty:

**Low Difficulty.** An encounter of low difficulty is likely to have one or two scary moments for the players, but their characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use healing resources, however. As a rough guideline, a single monster generally presents a low-difficulty challenge for a party of four characters whose level equals the monster's Challenge Rating.

**Moderate Difficulty.** Absent healing and other resources, an encounter of moderate difficulty could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the fight, and there's a slim chance that one or more characters might die.

**High Difficulty.** A high-difficulty encounter could be lethal for one or more characters. To survive it, the characters will need smart tactics, quick thinking, and maybe even a little luck.

#### Step 2: Determine Your XP Budget

Using the XP Budget per Character table, cross-reference the party's level with the desired encounter difficulty. Multiply the number in the table by the number of characters in the party to get your XP budget for the encounter.

Table: XP Budget per Character: ——— Encounter Difficulty ——— 

| Party's Level | Low DC | Moderate DC | High DC |
|---------------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1             | 50     | 75          | 100     |
| 2             | 100    | 150         | 200     |
| 3             | 150    | 225         | 400     |
| 4             | 250    | 375         | 500     |
| 5             | 500    | 750         | 1,100   |
| 6             | 600    | 1,000       | 1,400   |
| 7             | 750    | 1,300       | 1,700   |
| 8             | 1,000  | 1,700       | 2,100   |
| 9             | 1,300  | 2,000       | 2,600   |
| 10            | 1,600  | 2,300       | 3,100   |
| 11            | 1,900  | 2,900       | 4,100   |
| 12            | 2,200  | 3,700       | 4,700   |
| 13            | 2,600  | 4,200       | 5,400   |
| 14            | 2,900  | 4,900       | 6,200   |
| 15            | 3,300  | 5,400       | 7,800   |
| 16            | 3,800  | 6,100       | 9,800   |
| 17            | 4,500  | 7,200       | 11,700  |
| 18            | 5,000  | 8,700       | 14,200  |
| 19            | 5,500  | 10,700      | 17,200  |
| 20            | 6,400  | 13,200      | 22,000  |

#### Step 3: Spend Your Budget

Every creature has an XP value in its stat block. When you add a creature to your combat encounter, deduct its XP from your XP budget to determine how many XP you have left to spend. Spend as much of your XP budget as you can without going over. It's OK if you have a few unspent XP left over. Examples are given below:

**Example 1.** A low-difficulty encounter for four level 1 characters has an XP budget of 50 × 4, for a total of 200 XP. With that, you could build any of the following encounters:
- 1 **Bugbear Warrior** (200 XP)
- 2 **Giant Wasps** (100 XP each), for 200 XP total
- 6 **Giant Rats** (25 XP each), for 150 XP total

**Example 2.** A moderate-difficulty encounter for five level 3 characters has an XP budget of 225 × 5, for a total of 1,125 XP. With that, you could build either of these encounters:
- 2 **Druids** (450 XP each) and 9 **Stirges** (25 XP each), for 1,125 XP total
- 1 **Wight** (700 XP), 1 **Warhorse Skeleton** (100 XP), and 6 **Skeletons** (50 XP each), for 1,100 XP total

**Example 3.** A high-difficulty encounter for six level 15 characters has an XP budget of 7,800 × 6, for a total of 46,800 XP. With that, you could build this encounter:

- 2 **Adult Red Dragons** (18,000 XP each) and 2 **Fire Giants** (5,000 XP each), for 46,000 XP total

### Troubleshooting

When creating and running combat encounters, keep the following in mind.

#### Many Creatures

The more creatures in an encounter, the higher the risk that a lucky streak on their part could deal more damage to the characters than you expect. If your encounter includes more than two creatures per character, include fragile creatures that can be defeated quickly. This guideline is especially important for characters of level 1 or 2.

#### Adjustments

A player's absence might warrant removing creatures from an encounter to keep it at the intended difficulty. Also, die rolls and other factors can result in an encounter being easier or harder than intended. You can adjust an encounter on the fly, such as by having creatures flee (making the encounter easier) or adding reinforcements (making the encounter harder).

#### CR 0 Creatures

Creatures that have a CR of 0, particularly ones that are worth 0 XP, should be used sparingly. If you want to include many CR 0 critters in an encounter, use swarms instead.

#### Number of Stat Blocks

The best combat encounters often pair one kind of creature with another, such as fire giants paired with hell hounds. Be mindful of the number of stat blocks you need to run the encounter. Referencing more than two or three stat blocks for a single encounter can be daunting, particularly if the creatures are complex.

#### Powerful Creatures

If your combat encounter includes a creature whose CR is higher than the party's level, be aware that such a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to take out one or more characters. For example, an **Ogre** (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wizard with a single blow.

#### Unusual Features

If a monster has a feature that lower-level characters can't easily overcome, consider not adding that monster to an encounter for characters whose level is lower than the monster's Challenge Rating.

# Magic Items

Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways.

## Magic Item Categories

Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic Item Categories table lists the nine categories and provides examples. Rules for the categories appear after the table.

Table: Magic Item Categories

| Category       | Examples                           |
|----------------|------------------------------------|

### Armor

An item in the Armor category is typically a magical version of armor from "Equipment." Unless an armor's description notes otherwise, the armor must be worn for its magic to function.

Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If no type is specified, choose the type or determine it randomly.

### Potions

An item in the Potion category might be a magical brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.

**_Using a Potion._** Potions are consumable items. Drinking a potion or administering it to another creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil might take longer as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.

**_Mixing Potions._** A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another or pour several potions into a single container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions.

When a character mixes two potions together, roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become evident.

Table: Potion Miscibility

| 1d100 | Result                                                                                                                                      |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01    | Both potions lose their effects, and the mixture creates a magical explosion in a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area takes 4d10 Force damage. |
| 02–08 | Both potions lose their effects, and the mix ture becomes an ingested poison of your choice (see "Poison" in "Gameplay Toolbox").           |
| 09–15 | Both potions lose their effects.                                                                                                            |
| 16–25 | One potion loses its effect.                                                                                                                |
| 26–35 | Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. If a potion has no numerical effect and no duration, it instead loses its effect. |
| 36–90 | Both potions work normally.                                                                                                                 |
| 91–99 | Both potions work, but the numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If nei ther potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally. |
| 00    | Only one potion works, but its effects are permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a *Potion of Healing* might increase the drinker's Hit Point maximum by 2d4 + 2, or a *Potion of Invisibility* might give the drinker the Invisible condition indefinitely. At your discretion, a *Dispel Magic* spell or similar magic might end this lasting effect. |

### Rings

For its magic to function, an item in the Ring category must be worn on a finger or a similar digit unless its description notes otherwise.

### Rods

An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs 2 to 5 pounds.

Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can be used as an Arcane Focus.

### Scrolls

An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is the *Spell Scroll*, a spell stored in written form.

**_Using a Scroll._** Scrolls are consumable items. Unleashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.

Any creature that can understand a written language can read a scroll and attempt to activate it unless its description notes otherwise.

### Staffs

Items in the Staff category vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.

Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane Focus.

### Wands

An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material.

Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand can be used as an Arcane Focus.

### Weapons

A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a weapon from "Equipment." Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no weapon type is specified, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.

**_Ammunition._** If a magic weapon has the Ammunition property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares whether a weapon is magical or not.

### Wondrous Items

Wondrous Items include wearable items such as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and more also fall into this category.

> #### **Magic Item Rules**
>
> Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic items appear in "Equipment." Additional rules are presented below.
>
> **_Attunement Prerequisites._** If a magic item has a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. If a creature must be a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not by using a magic item or the like.
>
> **_Items Made for Specific Creatures._** Magic items that are meant to be worn tend to magically adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can decide that a magic item doesn't adjust its size to fit any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might make items usable only by folk who are sized and shaped like dwarves.
>
> **_Unusual Anatomy._** Use your discretion to decide whether a creature can wear an item not made for its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear magic boots.
>
> **_Paired Items._** You can allow exceptions to the rule that paired items must both be worn. For example, a character with only one arm might be able to use a single *Glove of Missile Snaring* so long as the matching glove is on their person.

## Magic Item Rarity

Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic Item Rarities and Values table.

Common magic items, such as a *Potion of Healing*, are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the *Dragon Orb*, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.

### Magic Item Values by Rarity

Common magic items can often be bought in a town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a city on another plane of existence. If you allow characters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign, rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities and Values table, though a seller might ask for a service rather than coin as payment.

If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost in "Equipment" (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), add that item's cost to the magic item's value. For example, *+1 Armor* (Plate Armor) has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare magic item's value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate Armor (1,500 GP).

Table: Magic Item Rarities and Values

| Rarity    | Value*     |
|-----------|------------|
| Common    | 100 GP     |
| Uncommon  | 400 GP     |
| Rare      | 4,000 GP   |
| Very Rare | 40,000 GP  |
| Legendary | 200,000 GP |
| Artifact  | Priceless  |

\*Halve the value for a consumable item other than a *Spell Scroll*. The value of a *Spell Scroll* is double what it costs to scribe the scroll (as specified in the "Scribing Spell Scrolls" section of "Equipment").

## Activating a Magic Item

It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic item. The item's user might also need to do something special. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation.

### Command Word

A command word is a word or short phrase that must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spoken command words must be audible and fail to work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in the area of the *Silence* spell.

### Consumable Items

Some items are consumed—used up, in other words—when they are activated. A *Potion of Healing* must be swallowed, for example, while the writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.

#### Spells Cast from Items

Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components unless the item's description notes otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects with its usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.

A magic item may require the user to use their own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting ability, the user chooses which one to use with the item. If the user doesn't have a spellcasting ability, their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and the user's Proficiency Bonus applies.

#### Charges

Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when the *Identify* spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to an item knows how many charges the item has and how many it regains.

## The Next Dawn"

Magic items often have charges or properties that recharge at the next dawn or some other specified time. If such an item is on a world or plane of existence where the specified event doesn't occur, the GM determines when the item recharges.

## Cursed Items

A magic item's description specifies whether it bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, including the *Identify* spell, fail to reveal such a curse.

Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a *Remove Curse* spell.

## Magic Item Resilience

A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Potions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage.

An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learning how to destroy an Artifact usually requires research or the completion of a quest.

## Crafting Magic Items

"Equipment" contains rules on brewing *Potions of Healing* and scribing *Spell Scrolls*. To create other magic items, follow the rules below. In these rules, "you" refers to the character crafting the magic item.

### Arcana Proficiency

To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must have proficiency in the Arcana skill.

### Tools

The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is required to make a magic item of each category. You must use the required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must also have proficiency with it. For more information on the tools, see "Equipment."

Table: Magic Item Tools

| Item Category | Required Tool                                                                                                                    |

### Spells

If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.

### Time and Cost

Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and money based on the item's rarity as shown in the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table.

**_Work per Day._** For each day of crafting, you must work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days, those days needn't be consecutive.

**_Assistants._** Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.

**_Raw Materials._** The cost in the table represents the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance that the materials are available, and in any other settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials aren't available, you must wait at least 7 days before checking on the availability again.

If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item using the rules in "Equipment." For example, to make *+1 Armor* (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500 GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor.

Table: Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost

| Item Rarity | Time*    | Cost*      |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| Common      | 5 days   | 50 GP      |
| Uncommon    | 10 days  | 200 GP     |
| Rare        | 50 days  | 2,000 GP   |
| Very Rare   | 125 days | 20,000 GP  |
| Legendary   | 250 days | 100,000 GP |

\*The time and cost are halved for a consumable item other than a *Spell Scroll*, whose crafting time and cost are given in "Equipment."

## Sentient Magic Items

Some magic items have sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.

The GM controls sentient magic items and their activated properties. A bearer who maintains a good relationship with the item can access those properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict can ensue (see "Conflict" below).

### Sentient Magic Item Traits

When you make a sentient magic item, you create the item's persona much as you would create an NPC, with these exceptions.

#### Abilities

A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Choose the item's abilities, or determine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.

#### Alignment

A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise, pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item's Alignment table.

#### Communication

A sentient item communicates by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the Sentient Item's Communication table.

#### Senses

A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the Sentient Item's Senses table.

#### Special Purpose

You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item (see "Conflict" below). You can pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item's Special Purpose table.

Table: Sentient Item's Alignment

| 1d100 | Alignment       |
|-------|-----------------|
| 01–15 | Lawful Good     |
| 16–35 | Neutral Good    |
| 36–50 | Chaotic Good    |
| 51–63 | Lawful Neutral  |
| 64–73 | Neutral         |
| 74–85 | Chaotic Neutral |
| 86–89 | Lawful Evil     |
| 90–96 | Neutral Evil    |
| 97–00 | Chaotic Evil    |

|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–6  | The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.                                                   |
| 7–9  | The item speaks one or more languages.                                                                                                   |
| 10   | The item speaks one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any creature that carries or wields it. |

|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Aligned.** The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. Such an item is never Neutral.    |
| 2    | **Bane.** The item seeks to thwart or destroy creatures of a particular type, such as Constructs, Fiends, or Undead.           |
| 3    | **Creator Seeker.** The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.                                     |
| 4    | **Destiny Seeker.** The item believes it and its bearer have key roles to play in future events.                               |
| 5    | **Destroyer.** The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.                                            |
| 6    | **Glory Seeker.** The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world by winning fame or notoriety for its user.     |
| 7    | **Lore Seeker.** The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy. |
| 8    | **Protector.** The item seeks to defend a particular kind of creature, such as elves or werewolves.                            |
| 9    | **Soulmate Seeker.** The item seeks another sentient magic item, perhaps one that is similar to itself.                        |
| 10   | **Templar.** The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity.                                        |

#### Conflict

When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item's bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the item makes one or more of the following demands:

**Chase My Dreams.** The item demands that its bearer pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.

**Get Rid of It.** The item demands that its bearer dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.

**It's Time for a Change.** The item demands to be given to someone else.

**Keep Me Close.** The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.

If its bearer refuses to comply with the item's demands, the item can do any of the following:

- Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it.
- Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
- Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the bearer has the Charmed condition for 1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the bearer must try to follow the item's commands. If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item can't use this power again until the next dawn.

## Magic Items A–Z

Magic items are presented in alphabetical order.

If a magic item description capitalizes a creature's name and presents it in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block. Unless the text states otherwise, the stat block is in "Monsters." How to read and use a stat block is explained in "Monsters."

#### Adamantine Armor

*Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor), Uncommon*

This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any Critical Hit against you becomes a normal hit.

#### Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3

*Weapon (Any Ammunition), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2), or Very Rare (+3)* 

You have a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.

This ammunition is typically found or sold in quantities of ten or twenty pieces. Ten pieces of this ammunition are equivalent in value to a potion of the same rarity.

#### Ammunition of Slaying

*Weapon (Any Ammunition), Very Rare* 

This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the GM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.

| 1d100 | Creature Type |
|-------|---------------|
| 01–10 | Aberrations   |
| 11–15 | Beasts        |
| 16–20 | Celestials    |
| 21–25 | Constructs    |
| 26–35 | Dragons       |
| 36–45 | Elementals    |
| 46–50 | Humanoids     |
| 51–60 | Fey           |
| 61–70 | Fiends        |
| 71–75 | Giants        |
| 76–80 | Monstrosities |
| 81–85 | Oozes         |
| 86–90 | Plants        |
| 91–00 | Undead        |

#### Amulet of Health

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

Your Constitution is 19 while you wear this amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is 19 or higher without it.

#### Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this amulet, you can't be targeted by Divination spells or perceived through magical scrying sensors unless you allow it.

#### Amulet of the Planes

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this amulet, you can take a Magic action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you cast *Plane Shift*. On a failed check, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination determined by rolling 1d100 and consulting the following table.

| 1d100 | Destination
|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| 01–60 | Random location on the plane you named  |
| 61–70 | Random location on an Inner Plane determined by rolling 1d6: on a **1,** the Plane of Air; on a **2,** the Plane of Earth; on a **3,** the Plane of Fire; on a **4,** the Plane of Water; on a **5,** the Feywild; on a **6,** the Shadowfell |
| 71–80 | Random location on an Outer Plane determined by rolling 1d8: on a **1,** Arborea; on a **2,** Arcadia; on a **3,** the Beastlands; on a **4,** Bytopia; on a **5,** Elysium; on a **6,** Mechanus; on a **7,** Mount Celestia; on an **8,** Ysgard |
| 81–90 | Random location on an Outer Plane determined by rolling 1d8: on a **1,** the Abyss; on a **2,** Acheron; on a **3,** Carceri; on a **4,** Gehenna; on a **5,** Hades; on a **6,** Limbo; on a **7,** the Nine Hells; on an **8,** Pandemonium |
| 91–00 | Random location on the Astral Plane     |

#### Animated Shield

*Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While holding this Shield, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to animate. The Shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The Shield remains animate for 1 minute, until you take a Bonus Action to end this effect, or until you die or have the Incapacitated condition, at which point the Shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.

#### Apparatus of the Crab

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* 

This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.

The *Apparatus of the Crab* is a Large object with the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30 ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren't extended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.

Table: Apparatus of the Crab Levers

| Lever | Up                                                     | Down                                       |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Legs extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim.  | Legs retract, reducing the apparatus's Speed and Swim Speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed. |
| 2     | Forward window shutter opens.                          | Forward window shutter closes.             |
| 3     | Side window shutters open (two per side).              | Side window shutters close (two per side). |
| 4     | Two claws extend from the front side of the apparatus. | The claws retract.                         |
| 5     | Each extended claw makes the following melee attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) Bludgeoning damage. | Each extended claw makes the following melee attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* The target has the Grappled condition (escape DC 15). |
| 6     | The apparatus walks or swims forward provided its legs are extended. | The apparatus walks or swims backward provided its legs are extended. |
| 7     | The apparatus turns 90 degrees counterclockwise provided its legs are extended. | The apparatus turns 90 degrees clockwise provided its legs are extended. |
| 8     | Eyelike fixtures emit Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. | The light turns off. 
| 9     | The apparatus sinks up to 20 feet if it's in liquid.   | The apparatus rises up to 20 feet if it's in liquid. |
| 10    | The rear hatch unseals and opens.                      | The rear hatch closes and seals.           |

#### Armor, +1, +2, or +3

*Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Rare (+1), Very Rare (+2), or Legendary (+3)* 

You have a bonus to Armor Class while wearing this armor. The bonus is determined by its rarity.

#### Armor of Invulnerability

*Armor (Plate Armor), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage while you wear this armor.

*Metal Shell.* You can take a Magic action to give yourself Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Armor of Resistance

*Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You have Resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly by rolling on the following table.

| 1d10 | Damage Type |
|------|-------------|
| 1    | Acid        |
| 2    | Cold        |
| 3    | Fire        |
| 4    | Force       |
| 5    | Lightning   |
| 6    | Necrotic    |
| 7    | Poison      |
| 8    | Psychic     |
| 9    | Radiant     |
| 10   | Thunder     |

#### Armor of Vulnerability

*Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this armor, you have Resistance to one of the following damage types: Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.

*Curse.* This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when the *Identify* spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a *Remove Curse* spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).

#### Arrow-Catching Shield

*Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus is in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.

Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

#### Bag of Beans

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of how many beans it contains and becomes a nonmagical item when it no longer contains any beans.

If you dump one or more beans out of the bag, they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table or determine it randomly.

| 1d100 | Effect                   |
|-------|--------------------------|
| 01    | 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary Hit Points for 1 hour. |
| 02–10 | A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM's choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d4 minutes. |
| 11–20 | A **Treant** sprouts. Roll any die. On an odd roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even roll, the treant is Chaotic Good. |
| 21–30 | An animate but immobile stone statue in your likeness rises and makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours. |
| 31–40 | A campfire with green flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours or until it is extinguished. |
| 41–50 | Three **Shrieker Fungi** sprout. |
| 51–60 | 1d4 + 4 bright-pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM's choice that acts in accordance with its alignment and nature. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright-pink smoke. |
| 61–70 | A hungry **Bulette** burrows up and attacks. |
| 71–80 | A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined potions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days. |
| 81–90 | A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 Force damage from an internal explosion. |
| 91–95 | A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a burial chamber containing a **Mummy,** a **Mummy Lord,** or some other Undead of the GM's choice. Its sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM's choice. |
| 96–00 | A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM's choice. The top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant's castle, or another plane of existence. |

#### Bag of Devouring

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* 

This bag resembles a *Bag of Holding* but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can take an action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Another creature can take an action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, provided the puller isn't pulled inside the bag first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.

#### Bag of Holding

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires a Utilize action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. The bag holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

Placing a *Bag of Holding* inside an extradimensional space created by a *Handy Haversack*, *Portable Hole*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can't be reopened.

#### Bag of Tricks

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This bag made from gray, rust, or tan cloth appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object.

You can take a Magic action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling on the table that corresponds to the bag's color. See "Monsters" for the creature's stat block. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 Hit Points.

The creature is Friendly to you and your allies, and it acts immediately after you on your Initiative count. You can take a Bonus Action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Bead of Force

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 *Beads of Force* are found together.

You can take a Magic action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a 10-foot-radius Sphere on impact and is destroyed. Each creature

in the Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are partially within the area are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can pass through.

An enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's Speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

#### Belt of Dwarvenkind

**Dwarvish.** You know Dwarvish.

**Friend of Dwarvenkind.** You have Advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with dwarves and duergar.

**Toughness.** Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.

**Darkvision.** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

**Resilience.** You have Resistance to Poison damage. You also have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Poisoned condition.

#### Belt of Giant Strength

*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this belt, your Strength changes to a score granted by the belt. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The item has no effect on you if your Strength without the belt is equal to or greater than the belt's score.

| Belt                                    | Str. | Rarity    |
|-----------------------------------------|------|-----------|

#### Berserker Axe

*Weapon (Battleaxe, Greataxe, or Halberd), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your Hit Point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

**_Curse._** This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have Disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one.

Whenever another creature damages you while the weapon is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. This berserk state ends when you start your turn and there are no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

While berserk, you regard the creature nearest to you that you can see or hear as your enemy. If there are multiple possible creatures, choose one at random. On each of your turns, you must move as close to the creature as possible and take the Attack action, targeting the creature. If you're unable to get close enough to the creature to attack it with the weapon, your turn ends after you've used up all your available movement. If the creature dies or can no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest creature that you can see or hear becomes your new target.

#### Boots of Elvenkind

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* 

While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

#### Boots of Levitation

While you wear these boots, you can cast *Levitate* on yourself.

#### Boots of Speed

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While you wear these boots, you can take a Bonus Action to click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your Speed, and any creature that makes an Opportunity Attack against you has Disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When you've used the boots' property for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Boots of Striding and Springing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While you wear these boots, your Speed becomes 30 feet unless your Speed is higher, and your Speed isn't reduced by you carrying weight in excess of your carrying capacity or wearing Heavy Armor.

Once on each of your turns, you can jump up to 30 feet by spending only 10 feet of movement.

#### Boots of the Winterlands

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the bowl as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It holds about 3 gallons.

The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the brazier as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or

when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Brooch of Shielding

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this brooch, you have Resistance to Force damage, and you have Immunity to damage from the *Magic Missile* spell.

#### Broom of Flying

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

This wooden broom functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and take a Magic action to make it hover beneath you, at which time it can be ridden in the air. It has a Fly Speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its Fly Speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land or when you're no longer riding it.

As a Magic action, you can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you name the location and are familiar with it. The broom comes back to you when you take a Magic action and use a command word if the broom is still within 1 mile of you.

#### Candle of Invocation

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a Magic action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have Advantage on D20 Tests. In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast *Gate* with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the GM or determined by rolling on the following table.

You can make this carpet hover and fly by taking a Magic action and using the carpet's command word. It moves according to your directions if you are within 30 feet of it.

Four sizes of *Carpet of Flying* exist. The GM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly by rolling on the following table. A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but its Fly Speed is halved if it carries more than its normal capacity.

| 1d100 | Size          | Capacity | Fly Speed |

#### Censer of Controlling Air Elementals

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

While gently swinging this censer, you can take a Magic action to summon an **Air Elemental**. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the censer as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The censer can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Chime of Opening

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. As a Magic action, you can strike the chime to cast *Knock*. The spell's customary knocking sound is replaced by the clear, ringing tone of the chime, which is audible out to 300 feet.

The chime can be used 10 times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.

#### Cloak of Displacement

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While you wear this cloak, it magically projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

While wearing this cloak, you have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In an area of Dim Light or Darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak and use it to gain a Fly Speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in Dim Light or Darkness, you lose this Fly Speed.

While wearing the cloak in an area of Dim Light or Darkness, you can cast *Polymorph* on yourself, shape-shifting into a **Bat**. While in that form, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

In addition, you can cast *Detect Thoughts* (save DC 17) targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor.

#### **Crystal Ball of Telepathy**

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast *Scrying* (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also cast *Suggestion* (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures.

The cube starts with 10 charges, and it regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

Table: Cube of Force Faces

| Wall of Force    | 5           |

#### Cubic Gate

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.

The cube has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. As a Magic action, you can expend 1 of the cube's charges to cast one of the following spells using the cube.

**_Gate._** Pressing one side of the cube, you cast *Gate*, opening a portal to the plane of existence keyed to that side.

**_Plane Shift._** Pressing one side of the cube twice, you cast *Plane Shift*, transporting the targets to the plane of existence keyed to that side.

#### Dagger of Venom

*Weapon (Dagger), Rare* 

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can take a Bonus Action to magically coat the blade with poison. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. The weapon can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Dancing Sword

*Weapon (Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, or Shortsword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You can take a Bonus Action to toss this magic weapon into the air. When you do so, the weapon begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of itself. The weapon uses your attack roll and adds your ability modifier to damage rolls.

While the weapon hovers, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same Bonus Action, you can cause the weapon to attack one creature within 5 feet of the weapon.

After the hovering weapon attacks for the fourth time, it flies back to you and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, the weapon falls to the ground in your space. If the weapon has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or are more than 30 feet away from it.

#### Decanter of Endless Water

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.

You can take a Magic action to remove the stopper and issue one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following command words:

**Splash.** The decanter produces 1 gallon of water. 

**Fountain.** The decanter produces 5 gallons of water. 

**Geyser.** The decanter produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a Line 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. If you're holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser in one direction (no action required). One creature of your choice in the Line must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition. Instead of a creature, you can target one object in the Line that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is knocked over by the geyser.

#### Deck of Illusions

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34 cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.

Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a *Dispel Magic* spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

Table: Deck of Illusions

\*Stat blocks for these creatures (except the card drawer) appear in "Monsters."

#### Defender

*Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The first time you attack with the weapon on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the weapon's bonus to your Armor Class. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it.

#### Demon Armor

*Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and you know Abyssal. In addition, the armor's clawed gauntlets allow your Unarmed Strikes to deal 1d8 Slashing damage instead of the usual Bludgeoning damage, and you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes.

**_Curse._** Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by a *Remove Curse* spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.

#### Dimensional Shackles

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.

#### Dragon Orb

*Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.

While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic action to peer into the orb's depths. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it.

While you are Charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts *Suggestion* on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.

**_Spells._** The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

| Spell                         | Charge Cost    |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Cure Wounds (level 9 version) | 4              |
| Daylight                      | 1              |
| Death Ward                    | 2              |
| Detect Magic                  | 0              |
| Scrying (save DC 18)          | 3              |

**_Call Dragons._** While you control the orb, you can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.

**_Destroying an Orb._** A *Dragon Orb* has AC 20 and is destroyed if it takes damage from a *+3 Weapon* or a *Disintegrate* spell. Nothing else can harm it.

#### Dragon Scale Mail

*Armor (Scale Mail), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)   *

*Dragon Scale Mail* is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them. Other times, hunters carefully preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, *Dragon Scale Mail* is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class, you have Advantage on saving throws against the breath weapons of Dragons, and you have Resistance to one damage type determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the accompanying table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as a Magic action to discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of yourself that is of the same type as the armor. This action can't be used again until the next dawn.

| Dragon | Resistance |
|--------|------------|
| Black  | Acid       |
| Blue   | Lightning  |
| Brass  | Fire       |
| Bronze | Lightning  |
| Copper | Acid       |
| Gold   | Fire       |
| Green  | Poison     |
| Red    | Fire       |
| Silver | Cold       |
| White  | Cold       |

#### Dragon Slayer

*Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Rare* 

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon's type if the target is a Dragon.

#### Dust of Disappearance

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* 

This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you take a Utilize action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within a 10-foot Emanation originating from you have the Invisible condition for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. Immediately after an affected creature makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible condition ends for that creature.

#### Dust of Dryness

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. A creature can take a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.

As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a **Water Elemental**). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Dust of Sneezing and Choking

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

Found in a small container, this powder resembles *Dust of Disappearance*, and *Identify* reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

As a Utilize action, you can throw the dust into the air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot

Emanation originating from you to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically.

On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the Incapacitated condition and is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a *Lesser Restoration* spell.

#### Dwarven Plate

*Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Very Rare*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can take a Reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.

#### Dwarven Thrower

*Weapon (Warhammer), Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Dwarf or a Creature Attuned to a Belt of Dwarvenkind)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the Thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is a Giant. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.

#### Efficient Quiver

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to 60 Arrows, Bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 Javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long objects, such as bows, Quarterstaffs, or Spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.

#### Efreeti Bottle

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

When you take a Magic action to remove the stopper of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an **Efreeti** appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls on the following table to determine what happens.

| 1d10 | Effect                       |
|------|------------------------------|
| 1    | The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 2–9  | The efreeti understands your languages and obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 10   | The efreeti understands your languages and can cast *Wish* once for you. It disappears when it grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic. |

#### Elemental Gem

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you take a Utilize action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned (see "Monsters" for its stat block), and the gem ceases to be magical. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the broken gem as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The type of gem determines the elemental, as shown in the following table.

| Gem            | Summoned Elemental |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Blue sapphire  | Air Elemental      |
| Emerald        | Water Elemental    |
| Red corundum   | Fire Elemental     |
| Yellow diamond | Earth Elemental    |

#### Elven Chain

*Armor (Chain Mail or Chain Shirt), Rare* 

You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class while you wear this armor. You are considered trained with this armor even if you lack training with Medium or Heavy armor.

#### Eversmoking Bottle

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

As a Magic action, you can open or close this bottle. Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot Emanation originating from the bottle. The area within the smoke is Heavily Obscured.

Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of the Emanation increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum size of 120 feet.

Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. A strong wind (such as that created by the *Gust of Wind* spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.

#### Eyes of Charming

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 or more charges to cast *Charm Person* (save DC 13). For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the spell. You increase the spell's level by one for each additional charge you expend. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Eyes of Minute Seeing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, your vision improves significantly out to a range of 1 foot, granting you Darkvision within that range and Advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to examine something within that range.

#### Eyes of the Eagle

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* 

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.

#### Feather Token

*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies*

This object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens table. The type of token determines its rarity.

**_Anchor (Uncommon)._** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.

**_Bird (Rare)._** You can take a Magic action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a **Roc**, but it can't attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a Magic action.

**_Fan (Uncommon)._** If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.

**_Swan Boat (Rare)._** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-footlong, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a Magic action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a Magic action.

**_Tree (Uncommon)._** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.

**_Whip (Rare)._** You can take a Magic action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.

As a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapacitated condition.

Table: Feather Tokens

| 1d100 | Token     | Rarity   |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 01–20 | Anchor    | Uncommon |
| 21–35 | Bird      | Rare     |
| 36–50 | Fan       | Uncommon |
| 51–65 | Swan boat | Rare     |
| 66–90 | Tree      | Uncommon |
| 91–00 | Whip      | Rare     |

#### Figurine of Wondrous Power

*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies* 

A *Figurine of Wondrous Power* is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

**_Bronze Griffon (Rare)._** This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a **Griffon** for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

**_Ebony Fly (Rare)._** This ebony statuette, carved in the likeness of a horsefly, can become a **Giant Fly** (see the accompanying stat block) for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

**_Golden Lions (Rare)._** These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a **Lion** for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

**_Ivory Goats (Rare)._** These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

**Goat of Terror.** This figurine can become a **Giant Goat** for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a *+1 Lance*, and the other becomes a *+2 Longsword*. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat,

any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

**_Goat of Traveling._** This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a **Riding Horse**. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.

**_Goat of Travail._** This figurine can become a **Giant Goat** for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

**_Marble Elephant (Rare)._** This marble statuette resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an **Elephant** for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

**_Obsidian Steed (Very Rare)._** This polished obsidian horse can become a **Nightmare** for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.

**_Onyx Dog (Rare)._** This onyx statuette of a dog can become a **Mastiff** for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has Blindsight with a range of 60 feet. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

**_Serpentine Owl (Rare)._** This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a **Giant Owl** for up to 8 hours. The owl can communicate telepathically with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

**_Silver Raven (Uncommon)._** This silver statuette of a raven can become a **Raven** for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine grants you the ability to cast *Animal Messenger* on it.

#### Flame Tongue

*Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While holding this magic weapon, you can take a Bonus Action and use a command word to cause flames to engulf the damage-dealing part of the weapon. These flames shed Bright Light in a 40 foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet. While the weapon is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit. The flames last until you take a Bonus Action to issue the command again or until you drop, stow, or sheathe the weapon.

#### Folding Boat

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring a Magic action to use:

**First Command Word.** The box unfolds into a Rowboat.

**Second Command Word.** The box unfolds into a Keelboat.

**Third Command Word.** The *Folding Boat* folds back into a box if no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.

Statistics for the Rowboat and Keelboat appear in "Equipment." If either vessel is reduced to 0 Hit Points, the *Folding Boat* is destroyed.

#### Frost Brand

**First Command Word.** The gem sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you take a Bonus Action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.

**Second Command Word.** You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Third Command Word.** You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30 foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.

#### Gem of Seeing

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. You can also take a Bonus Action to cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks like—including color, style, and accessories—but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or doff the armor.

#### Gloves of Missile Snaring

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

If you're hit by an attack roll made with a Ranged or Thrown weapon while wearing these gloves, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier if you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the ammunition or weapon if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.

#### Gloves of Swimming and Climbing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing these gloves, you have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.

#### Goggles of Night

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* 

While wearing these dark lenses, you have Darkvision out to 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.

#### Hammer of Thunderbolts

*Weapon (Maul or Warhammer), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The weapon has 5 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the weapon, hurling it as if it had the Thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the weapon unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the Stunned condition until the end of your next turn. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand. The weapon regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

**_Giant's Bane._** While you are attuned to the weapon and wearing either a *Belt of Giant Strength* or *Gauntlets of Ogre Power* to which you are also attuned, you gain the following benefits:

**Giants' Bane.** When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll made with this weapon against a Giant, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.

**Might of Giants.** The Strength score bestowed by your *Belt of Giant Strength* or *Gauntlets of Ogre Power* increases by 4, to a maximum of 30.

#### Handy Haversack

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.

Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.

If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again.

Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a *Bag of Holding*, *Portable Hole*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

#### Hat of Disguise

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this hat, you can cast the *Disguise Self* spell. The spell ends if the hat is removed.

#### Headband of Intellect

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

Your Intelligence is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is 19 or higher without it.

#### Helm of Brilliance

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

You gain the following benefits while wearing the helm.

**_Diamond Light._** As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits a 30-foot Emanation. When at least one Undead is within that area, the Emanation is filled with Dim Light. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 Radiant damage.

**_Fire Opal Flames._** As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can take a Magic action to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage. The flames last until you take a Bonus Action to extinguish them or until you drop or stow the weapon.

**_Ruby Resistance._** As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to Fire damage.

**_Spells._** You can cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: *Daylight* (opal), *Fireball* (fire opal), *Prismatic Spray* (diamond), or *Wall of Fire* (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.

**_Taking Fire Damage._** Roll 1d20 if you are wearing the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60 foot Emanation originating from you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm.

#### Helm of Comprehending Languages

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* 

While wearing this helm, you can cast *Comprehend Languages* from it.

#### Helm of Telepathy

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and you can cast *Detect Thoughts* or *Suggestion* (save DC 13) from the helm. Once either spell is cast from the helm, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.

#### Helm of Teleportation

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast *Teleport* from it. The helm regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Holy Avenger

*Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Paladin)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 Radiant damage.

While you hold the drawn weapon, it creates a 10-foot Emanation originating from you. You and all creatures Friendly to you in the Emanation have Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the Paladin class, the size of the Emanation increases to 30 feet.

#### Horn of Blasting

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

You can take a Magic action to blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot Cone that is audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the Cone makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 Thunder damage and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried take 10d8 Thunder damage.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 Force damage to the user and destroys the horn.

#### Horn of Valhalla

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Silver or Brass), Very Rare (Bronze), or Legendary (Iron)*

You can take a Magic action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the **Berserker** stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of *Horn of Valhalla* are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many spirits it summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly by rolling on the following table.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned spirits attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are Friendly to you and your allies and follow your commands.

| 1d100 | Horn Type | Spirits | Requirement                          |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| 01–40 | Silver    | 2       | None                                 |
| 41–75 | Brass     | 3       | Proficiency with all Simple weapons  |
| 76–90 | Bronze    | 4       | Training with all Medium armor       |
| 91–00 | Iron      | 5       | Proficiency with all Martial weapons |

#### Horseshoes of a Zephyr

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a Magic action.

While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above a surface. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores Difficult Terrain. In addition, the creature can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining Exhaustion levels from extended travel.

#### Horseshoes of Speed

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a Magic action.

While all four horseshoes are attached to the same creature, its Speed is increased by 30 feet.

#### Immovable Rod

*Rod, Uncommon*

This iron rod has a button on one end. You can take a Utilize action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature takes a Utilize action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it defies gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can take a Utilize action to make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a successful check.

#### Instant Fortress

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

As a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch adamantine statuette on the ground and, using a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a square adamantine tower. Repeating the command word causes the tower to revert to statuette form, which works only if the tower is empty. Each creature in the area where the tower appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried are also pushed clear of the tower.

The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When created, the tower has a single door at ground level on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the *Knock* spell and similar magic.

Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20; HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage except that which is dealt by siege equipment; and Resistance to all other damage. Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form doesn't repair damage to the tower. Only a *Wish* spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of level 8 or lower). Each casting of *Wish* causes the tower to regain all its Hit Points.

#### Ioun Stone

*Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)*

Roughly marble sized, *Ioun Stones* are named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of *Ioun Stones* exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.

When you take a Magic action to toss an *Ioun Stone* into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you while doing so. You can have up to three *Ioun Stones* orbiting your head at the same time.

Each *Ioun Stone* orbiting your head is considered to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.

As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any number of *Ioun Stones* orbiting your head. If your Attunement to an *Ioun Stone* ends while it's orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped it.

The type of stone determines its rarity and effects.

**_Absorption (Very Rare)._** While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic.

**_Agility (Very Rare)._** Your Dexterity increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere orbits your head.

**_Awareness (Rare)._** While this dark-blue rhomboid orbits your head, you have Advantage on Initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.

**_Fortitude (Very Rare)._** Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.

**_Greater Absorption (Legendary)._** While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 8 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic.

**_Insight (Very Rare)._** Your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.

**_Intellect (Very Rare)._** Your Intelligence increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.

**_Leadership (Very Rare)._** Your Charisma increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.

**_Mastery (Legendary)._** Your Proficiency Bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.

**_Protection (Rare)._** You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class while this dusty-rose prism orbits your head.

**_Regeneration (Legendary)._** You regain 15 Hit Points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head if you have at least 1 Hit Point.

**_Reserve (Rare)._** This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4 into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

**_Strength (Very Rare)._** Your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.

**_Sustenance (Rare)._** You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.

#### Iron Bands

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature that can touch the bands, including the one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Iron Flask

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you can take a Magic action to target a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask is empty and the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't age and doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink.

You can take a Magic action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature in the flask. The creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, understanding those commands even if it doesn't know the language in which the commands are given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.

An *Identify* spell reveals if the flask contains a creature, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered *Iron Flask* might already contain a creature chosen by the GM.

#### Javelin of Lightning

*Weapon (Javelin), Uncommon* 

Each time you make an attack roll with this magic weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning damage instead of Piercing damage.

*Lightning Bolt.* When you throw this weapon at a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms a 5-foot-wide Line between you and the target. The target and each other creature in the Line (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in your hand. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Lantern of Revealing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* 

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's Bright Light. You can take a Utilize action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern's light to Dim Light in a 5-foot radius.

#### Luck Blade

*Weapon (Glaive, Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, Sickle, or Shortsword), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the weapon is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.

*Luck.* If the weapon is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one failed D20 Test if you don't have the Incapacitated condition. You must use the second roll. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

*Wish.* The weapon has 1d3 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge and cast *Wish* from it. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. The weapon loses this property if it has no charges.

#### Mace of Disruption

*Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 Radiant damage. If the target has 25 Hit Points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature has the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn.

**_Light._** While you hold this weapon, it sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.

#### Mace of Smiting

*Weapon (Mace), Rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the weapon to attack a Construct.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 7 Bludgeoning damage, or 14 Bludgeoning damage if it's a Construct. If a Construct has 25 Hit Points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.

#### Mace of Terror

*Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the weapon, you can take a Magic action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While Frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't make Opportunity Attacks. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Mantle of Spell Resistance

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You have Advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.

#### Manual of Bodily Health

The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a century.

#### Manual of Golems

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly by rolling on the accompanying table. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two level 5 spell slots. A creature that can't use a *Manual of Golems* and attempts to read it takes 6d6 Psychic damage.

To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.

Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. See "Monsters" for the golem's stat block. The golem is under your control, and it understands and obeys your commands.

| 1d20  | Golem       | Time     | Cost       |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1–5   | Clay Golem  | 30 days  | 65,000 GP  |
| 6–17  | Flesh Golem | 60 days  | 50,000 GP  |
| 18    | Iron Golem  | 120 days | 100,000 GP |
| 19–20 | Stone Golem | 90 days  | 80,000 GP  |

#### Manual of Quickness of Action

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a century.

#### Marvelous Pigments

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total).

Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.

When the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube.

No object created by a pot of pigment can have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects created by a pot of pigment can't exceed 500 GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they're made from paste, cookies, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm.

#### Medallion of Thoughts

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

The medallion has 5 charges. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast *Detect Thoughts* (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Mirror of Life Trapping

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror's nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.

While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate.

In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a *Bag of Holding*, *Portable Hole*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

#### Mithral Armor

*Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor), Uncommon*

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made of this substance can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.

#### Mysterious Deck

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Mysterious Deck table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.

Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)

| 97–00                | 97–00                | Void    |

Each card's effect is described below.

**_Balance._** You can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can't decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.

**_Comet._** The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect.

**_Donjon._** You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you're wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a *Wish* spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.

**_Euryale._** The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.

**_Fates._** Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

**_Flames._** A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

**_Fool._** You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn't count as one of your declared draws.

**_Gem._** Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.

**_Jester._** You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

**_Key._** A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The GM chooses the weapon.

**_Knight._** You gain the service of a **Knight**, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your GM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The GM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.

**_Moon._** You gain the ability to cast *Wish* 1d3 times.

**_Puzzle._** Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

**_Rogue._** An NPC of the GM's choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a *Wish* spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.

**_Ruin._** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.

**_Sage._** At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.

**_Skull._** An **Avatar of Death** (see the accompanying stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close

to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another **Avatar of Death**. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can't be restored to life.

**_Star._** Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.

**_Sun._** A magic item (chosen by the GM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die.

**_Talons._** Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.

**_Throne._** You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.

**_Void._** Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A *Wish* spell can't return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.

#### Necklace of Adaptation

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have Advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the Poisoned condition.

#### Necklace of Fireballs

*Wondrous Item, Rare* 

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can take a Magic action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 *Fireball* (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the damage of the *Fireball* by 1d6 for each bead after the first (maximum 12d6).

#### Necklace of Prayer Beads

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Cleric, Druid, or Paladin)*

This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.

Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a Bonus Action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.

| 1d20  | Bead                 | Spell                         |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1–6   | Bead of Blessing     | Bless                         |

| 13–16 | Bead of Favor        | Greater Restoration           |
| 17–18 | Bead of Smiting      | Shining Smite                 |
| 19    | Bead of Summons      | Guardian of Faith             |
| 20    | Bead of Wind Walking | Wind Walk                     |

#### Nine Lives Stealer

*Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

**_Life Stealing._** The weapon has 1d8 + 1 charges. When you attack a creature that has fewer than 100 Hit Points with this weapon and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body. Constructs and Undead succeed on the save automatically. The weapon loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the weapon has no charges remaining, it loses this property.

#### Oathbow

*Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter or sign the following command words: "Swift death to you who have wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.

When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have Advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from Half Cover or Three-Quarters Cover, and you suffer no Disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 Piercing damage.

While your sworn enemy lives, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.

#### Oil of Etherealness

*Potion, Rare*

One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the *Etherealness* spell for 1 hour.

Beads of this cloudy, gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate.

#### Oil of Sharpness

*Potion, Very Rare*

One vial of this oil can coat one Melee weapon or twenty pieces of ammunition, but only ammunition and Melee weapons that are nonmagical and deal Slashing or Piercing damage are affected. Applying the oil takes 1 minute, after which the oil magically seeps into whatever it coats, turning the coated weapon into a *+3 Weapon* or the coated ammunition into *+3 Ammunition*.

This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards.

#### Oil of Slipperiness

*Potion, Uncommon*

One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the *Freedom of Movement* spell for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as a Magic action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the *Grease* spell in that area for 8 hours.

This sticky, black unguent is thick and heavy, but it flows quickly when poured.

#### Pearl of Power

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

While this pearl is on your person, you can take a Magic action to regain one expended spell slot of level 3 or lower. Once you use the pearl, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Periapt of Health

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this pendant, you can take a Magic action to regain 2d4 + 2 Hit Points. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

In addition, you have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Poisoned condition while you wear this pendant.

#### Periapt of Proof against Poison

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, you have Immunity to the Poisoned condition and Poison damage.

#### Periapt of Wound Closure

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this pendant, you gain the following benefits.

**_Life Preservation._** Whenever you make a Death Saving Throw, you can change a roll of 9 or lower to a 10, turning a failed save into a successful one.

**_Natural Healing Boost._** Whenever you roll a Hit Point Die to regain Hit Points, double the number of Hit Points it restores.

#### Philter of Love

*Potion, Uncommon* 

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you are charmed by that creature and have the Charmed condition for 1 hour.

This rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.

#### Pipes of Haunting

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can take a Magic action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save repeats it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours.

#### Pipes of the Sewers

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rats and giant rats are Indifferent toward you and won't attack you unless you threaten or harm them.

The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one **Swarm of Rats** with each expended charge if enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise.

Whenever a **Swarm of Rats** that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes Friendly to you and your allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn more than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

#### Plate Armor of Etherealness

*Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

While you're wearing this armor, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to gain the effect of the *Etherealness* spell. The spell ends immediately if you remove the armor or take a Magic action to repeat the command word. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Portable Hole

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can take a Magic action to unfold a *Portable Hole* and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the *Portable Hole* creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open *Portable Hole* can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can take a Magic action to close a *Portable Hole* by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the *Portable Hole*. A closed *Portable Hole* holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

Placing a *Portable Hole* inside an extradimensional space created by a *Bag of Holding*, *Handy Haversack*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

#### Potion of Animal Friendship

*Potion, Uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you can cast the level 3 version of the *Animal Friendship* spell (save DC 13).

Agitating this potion's muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird feather, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.

#### Potion of Clairvoyance

*Potion, Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *Clairvoyance* spell (no Concentration required).

An eyeball bobs in this potion's yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened.

#### Potion of Climbing

*Potion, Common*

When you drink this potion, you gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have Advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to climb.

This potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.

#### Potion of Diminution

*Potion, Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the *Enlarge/Reduce* spell for 1d4 hours (no Concentration required).

The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.

#### Potion of Flying

*Potion, Very Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you're in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft.

This potion's clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.

#### Potion of Gaseous Form

*Potion, Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *Gaseous Form* spell for 1 hour (no Concentration required) or until you end the effect as a Bonus Action.

While summoned, the djinni is Friendly to you and your allies, and it obeys your commands. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.

After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.

*Rings of Djinni Summoning* are often created by the djinn they summon and given to mortals as gifts of friendship or tokens of esteem.

If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife.

As a Bonus Action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind Total Cover, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

| Number of Spheres | Lightning Damage | Number of Spheres | Lightning Damage |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1                 | 4d12             | 3                 | 2d6              |

#### Ring of Spell Storing

*Ring, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 5 into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

#### Ring of Spell Turning

*Ring, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you have Advantage on saving throws against spells. If you succeed on the save for a spell of level 7 or lower, the spell has no effect on you.

The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 Force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.

Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's charges as a Magic action to try to break a nonmagical object you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn't being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.

#### Ring of Three Wishes

*Ring, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can take a Magic action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead block the vision.

Whenever you use the ring again before taking a Long Rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level.

**_Drawbacks._** A *Light* spell cast on the robe or a *Daylight* spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives you the Blinded condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for *Light* or DC 15 for *Daylight*), ending the condition on yourself on a success.

#### Robe of Scintillating Colors

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can take a Magic action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

The robe has two of each of the following patches:

In addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches. The GM chooses the patches or determines them randomly by rolling on the following table.

#### Rod of Absorption

*Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn't create an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.

When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.

If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.

A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.

#### Rod of Alertness

*Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This rod has the following properties.

**_Alertness._** While holding the rod, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on Initiative rolls.

**_Spells._** While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:

- *Detect Evil and Good*
- *Detect Magic*
- *Detect Poison and Disease*
- *See Invisibility*

**_Protective Aura._** As a Magic action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds Bright Light in a 60-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. While in that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can sense the location of any Invisible creature that is also in the Bright Light.

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Rod of Lordly Might

*Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

**_Buttons._** You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form:

**Button 1.** A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head. The flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.

**Button 2.** The rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

**Button 3.** The rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

**Button 4.** The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod's buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

**Button 5.** The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.

**Button 6.** The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.

**_Drain Life._** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**_Paralyze._** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**_Terrify._** While holding the rod, you can take a Magic action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Rod of Rulership

*Rod, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You can take a Magic action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for 8 hours. While Charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your allies or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this way. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Rod of Security

*Rod, Very Rare*

While holding this rod, you can take a Magic action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern, an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane's environment can't harm its occupants. Everything else that can be interacted with there can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden there disappears if it is taken outside the demiplane.

For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die. Also, creatures don't age while there, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).

When the time runs out or you take a Magic action to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod or an unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used, this property can't be used again until 10 days have passed.

#### Rope of Climbing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This 60-foot length of rope can hold up to 3,000 pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a Magic action to command the other end of the rope to animate and move toward a destination you choose, up to the rope's length away from you. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet at the start of each of your subsequent turns until reaching its destination or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.

If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advantage on ability checks made to climb using the rope.

The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.

#### Rope of Entanglement

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a Magic action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target's space) or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand).

A target Restrained by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If you're still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a Reaction to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target's space.

The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.

#### Scarab of Protection

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This beetle-shaped medallion provides three benefits while it is on your person.

**_Defense._** You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.

**_Preservation._** The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a Necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an Undead, you can take a Reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.

**_Spell Resistance.* You have Advantage on saving throws against spells.

#### Scimitar of Speed

*Weapon (Scimitar), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a Bonus Action on each of your turns.

#### Shield, +1, +2, or +3

*Armor (Shield), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2), or Very Rare (+3)*

While holding this Shield, you have a bonus to Armor Class determined by the Shield's rarity, in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.

#### Shield of Missile Attraction

*Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While holding this Shield, you have Resistance to damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.

**_Curse._** This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a *Remove Curse* spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.

#### Slippers of Spider Climbing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed. However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.

#### Sovereign Glue

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with *Oil of Slipperiness*. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. Applying an ounce of *Sovereign Glue* takes a Utilize action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of *Universal Solvent* or *Oil of Etherealness*, or with a *Wish* spell.

#### Spellguard Shield

*Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)* 

While holding this Shield, you have Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attack rolls have Disadvantage against you.

#### Spell Scroll

*Scroll, Rarity Varies*

A *Spell Scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without Material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll isn't lost.

If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast the spell. The DC equals 10 plus the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the following table.

| Spell Level | Rarity    | Save DC | Attack Bonus |
|-------------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Cantrip     | Common    | 13      | +5           |
| 1           | Common    | 13      | +5           |
| 2           | Uncommon  | 13      | +5           |
| 3           | Uncommon  | 15      | +7           |
| 4           | Rare      | 15      | +7           |
| 5           | Rare      | 17      | +9           |
| 6           | Very Rare | 17      | +9           |
| 7           | Very Rare | 18      | +10          |
| 8           | Very Rare | 18      | +10          |
| 9           | Legendary | 19      | +11          |

**_Copying a Scroll into a Spellbook._** A Wizard spell on a *Spell Scroll* can be copied into a spellbook. When a spell is copied in this way, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 plus the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell is copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the *Spell Scroll* is destroyed.

#### Sphere of Annihilation

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.

The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a *Sphere of Annihilation*, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.

**_Controlling the Sphere._** A *Sphere of Annihilation* is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line.

While in control of the sphere, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains.

**_Sphere Interactions._** If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the *Gate* spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a *Portable Hole*), the GM determines randomly what happens using the following table.

| 1d100 | Result                                                                                                                     |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01–50 | The sphere is destroyed.                                                                                                   |
| 51–85 | The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.                                                    |
| 86–00 | A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere to a random plane of existence. |

**_Regaining Charges._** The staff regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.

**_Retributive Strike._** You can take a Magic action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its magic in an explosion that fills a 30-foot Emanation originating from itself. You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take Force damage equal to 16 times the number of charges in the staff. Each other creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes Force damage equal to 6 times the number of charges in the staff. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

#### Staff of the Python

*Staff, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

As a Magic action, you can throw this staff so that it lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, causing the staff to become a **Giant Constrictor Snake** in that space. The snake is under your control and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours.

On your turn, you can mentally command the snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the Incapacitated condition. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. Absent commands from you, the snake defends itself.

As a Bonus Action, you can command the snake to revert to staff form in its current space, and you can't use the staff's property again for 1 hour. If the snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.

#### Staff of the Woodlands

*Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Druid)*

This staff has 6 charges and can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

**_Spells._** While holding the staff, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it, using your spell save DC. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

| Spell                    | Charge Cost |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Animal Friendship        | 1           |

**_Tree Form._** You can take a Magic action to plant one end of the staff in earth in an unoccupied space and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation magic that can be discerned with the *Detect Magic* spell. While touching the tree and using a Magic action, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when the tree reverts to a staff.

**_Regaining Charges._** The staff regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.

#### Staff of Thunder and Lightning

*Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following additional properties. Once one of these properties is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

**_Lightning._** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 Lightning damage (no action required).

**_Thunder._** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder audible out to 300 feet (no action required). The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the Stunned condition until the end of your next turn.

**_Thunder and Lightning._** Immediately after you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can take a Bonus Action to use the Lightning and Thunder properties (see above) at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.

**_Lightning Strike._** You can take a Magic action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a Line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that Line makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Thunderclap._** You can take a Magic action to cause the staff to produce a thunderclap audible out to 600 feet. Every creature within a 60-foot Emanation originating from you makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 Thunder damage and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

#### Staff of Withering

*Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This staff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

The staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal Quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 2d10 Necrotic damage to the target and force it to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has Disadvantage for 1 hour on any ability check or saving throw that uses Strength or Constitution.

#### Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

While touching this 5-pound stone to the ground, you can take a Magic action to summon an **Earth Elemental**. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone)

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While this polished agate is on your person, you gain a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws.

#### Sun Blade

*Weapon (Longsword), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

This item appears to be a sword hilt.

**_Blade of Radiance._** While grasping the hilt, you can take a Bonus Action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic weapon functions as a Longsword with the Finesse property. If you are proficient with Longswords or Shortswords, you are proficient with the *Sun Blade*.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals Radiant damage instead of Slashing damage. When you hit an Undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

**_Sunlight._** The sword's luminous blade emits Bright Light in a 15-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can take a Magic action to expand or reduce its radius of Bright Light and Dim Light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.

#### Sword of Life Stealing

#### Sword of Sharpness

*Weapon (Glaive, Greatsword, Longsword, or Scimitar), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

When you attack an object with this magic weapon and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 Slashing damage and gains 1 Exhaustion level.

#### Sword of Wounding

*Weapon (Glaive, Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, or Shortsword), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

When you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 Necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be unable to regain Hit Points for 1 hour. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Talisman of Pure Good

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Cleric or Paladin)*

This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A Fiend or an Undead that touches the talisman takes 8d6 Radiant damage and takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

**_Holy Symbol._** You can use the talisman as a Holy Symbol. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

**_Pure Rebuke._** The talisman has 7 charges. While wearing or holding the talisman, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is a Fiend or an Undead, it has Disadvantage on the save. On a failed save, the target falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no remains. On a successful save, the target isn't cast into the fissure but takes 4d6 Psychic damage from the ordeal. In either case, the fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed.

#### Talisman of the Sphere

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

While holding or wearing this talisman, you have Advantage on any Intelligence (Arcana) check you make to control a *Sphere of Annihilation*.

This movement doesn't have to be in a straight line.

#### Talisman of Ultimate Evil

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that isn't a Fiend or an Undead that touches the talisman takes 8d6 Necrotic damage and takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

**_Holy Symbol._** You can use the talisman as a Holy Symbol. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

**_Ultimate End._** The talisman has 6 charges. While wearing or holding the talisman, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is a Celestial, it has Disadvantage on the save. On a failed save, the target falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no remains. On a successful save, the target isn't cast into the fissure but takes 4d6 Psychic damage from the ordeal. In either case, the fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.

#### Tome of Clear Thought

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores Resistance to Slashing damage.

When you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it has Immunity to Slashing damage, if it doesn't have or need a head, or if the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 30 Slashing damage from the hit. If the creature has Legendary Resistance, it can expend one daily use of that trait to avoid losing its head, taking the extra damage instead.

| 21–25 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you have the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened. |
| 26–30 | You cast *Gust of Wind*. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin. |
| 31–35 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage. |

| 51–55 | The creature closest to the chosen point of origin is enlarged as if you had cast *Enlarge/ Reduce* on it. If the target isn't you and can't be affected by that spell, you become the target instead. |
| 56–60 | A magically formed creature appears in an unoccupied space as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. The creature isn't under your control, acts as it normally would, and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which creature appears. On a **1,** a **Rhinoceros** appears; on a **2,** an **Elephant** appears; and on a **3–4,** a **Rat** appears. |

| 83–87 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you cast *Invisibility* on yourself. |

Instead, a stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand's tip in a Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the Line. |

#### Well of Many Worlds

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* 

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can take a Magic action to unfold the *Well of Many Worlds* and place it on a solid surface, whereupon it forms a two-way, 6-foot-diameter, circular portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. The portal remains open until a creature within 5 feet of it takes a Magic action to close it by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.

Once the *Well of Many Worlds* has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.

#### Wind Fan

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* 

While holding this fan, you can cast *Gust of Wind* (save DC 13) from it. Each subsequent time the fan is used before the next dawn, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working; if the fan fails to work, it tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.

# Monsters

## Stat Block Overview

A monster has a stat block that contains the rules necessary to use it in the game. Stat blocks are divided into the following parts:

- **Name and General Details.** The name of the monster is followed by its size, creature type (along with any descriptive tags), and alignment.
- **Combat Highlights.** Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed, and Initiative are provided here.
- **Ability Scores.** A monster's ability scores, ability modifiers, and saving throws are listed here.
- **Other Details.** The monster's Senses, Languages, and CR entries appear here. Additional details appear in some monsters, such as skill proficiencies, Resistances, Immunities, and Gear. If a monster lacks those details, entries for them don't appear.
- **Traits.** Monster characteristics that are active at all times or during certain situations appear here.
- **Actions.** The monster can take the actions here in addition to those in "Playing the Game."
- **Bonus Actions.** This section provides a monster's Bonus Actions, if any.
- **Reactions and Legendary Actions.** These sections provide Reactions and Legendary Actions, if any.

## Parts of a Stat Block

The rules for a stat block are detailed in "Rules Glossary" and in this section.

### Size

A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you choose the creature's size from those options. See "Playing the Game" for information on size.

### Creature Type

Each monster has a tag that identifies the type of creature it is. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type.

The game includes the following creature types, which have no rules of their own:

- **Aberrations** are utterly alien beings, such as aboleths and cloakers.
- **Beasts** are non-Humanoid natural creatures, like horses and wolves, as well as most giant animals.
- **Celestials** are magical creatures, such as angels and pegasi, with ties to the Upper Planes.
- **Constructs** are magically created creatures such as homunculi and shield guardians.
- **Dragons** are scaly beings of ancient origin, such as red dragons and wyverns.
- **Elementals** are beings from the Elemental Planes, such as efreet and water elementals.
- **Fey** are creatures tied to the Feywild or the forces of nature, such as dryads and goblins.
- **Fiends** are creatures tied to terrifying Lower Planes, such as balors and hell hounds.
- **Giants** are towering beings with humanlike shapes, like fire giants and trolls.
- **Humanoids** are people defined by their roles and professions, such as mages, pirates, and warriors. They include members of varied species.
- **Monstrosities** are unnatural creatures with strange origins, such as mimics and owlbears.
- **Oozes** are gelatinous creatures, including black puddings and gelatinous cubes.
- **Plants** are sentient vegetation and fungal monsters, such as shambling mounds and treants.
- **Undead** are spirits and the reanimated dead, such as ghosts, vampires, and zombies.

#### Descriptive Tags

A monster might have one or more tags in parentheses following its type. Such tags provide additional categorization and have no rules of their own, but certain game effects might refer to them.

### Alignment

The alignment specified in a monster's stat block is a default suggestion of how to roleplay the monster, inspired by its traditional role in the game or realworld folklore. Change a monster's alignment to suit your storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment, in particular, is an invitation for you to consider whether an individual leans toward one of the other alignments.

"Character Creation" describes the nine alignments and unaligned creatures.

### Armor Class

A monster's Armor Class (AC) includes its natural armor, Dexterity, gear, and other defenses. See "Playing the Game" for information on Armor Class.

### Initiative

The Initiative entry specifies the monster's Initiative modifier followed by the monster's Initiative score in parentheses. Use the modifier when you roll to determine a monster's Initiative. A monster's Initiative modifier is typically equal to its Dexterity modifier, but some monsters have additional modifiers, such as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that number.

If you don't want to roll a monster's Initiative, use the Initiative score as the monster's Initiative in combat. Initiative is further detailed in "Playing the Game*."*

### Hit Points

A monster's Hit Points are presented as a number followed by parentheses, where the monster's Hit Point Dice are provided, along with any contribution from its Constitution. Either use the number for the monster's Hit Points or roll the die expression in parentheses to determine the monster's Hit Points randomly; don't use both.

A monster's size typically determines the die used to calculate its Hit Points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.

Table: Hit Dice by Size

| Monster Size | Hit Die | Average HP per Die |
|--------------|---------|--------------------|
| Tiny         | d4      | 2½                 |
| Small        | d6      | 3½                 |
| Medium       | d8      | 4½                 |
| Large        | d10     | 5½                 |
| Huge         | d12     | 6½                 |
| Gargantuan   | d20     | 10½                |

A monster's Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its Hit Points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 Hit Points (average 11).

For more on Hit Points, see "Playing the Game*."*

### Speed

The Speed entry specifies a monster's Speed. Some monsters have one or more of the following speeds: Burrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these specials speeds appear in "Rules Glossary*."*

### Ability Scores

Every monster has six ability scores along with corresponding ability score modifiers and saving throw modifiers. For more information on ability scores and saving throws, see "Playing the Game*."*

### Skills

The Skills entry specifies a monster's skill proficiencies, if any. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its Proficiency Bonus. Other modifiers might apply.

### Resistances and Vulnerabilities

These entries list a monster's Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if any. See "Playing the Game" for more information.

> ### Running a Monster
>
> To ensure a monster acts in accordance with its Challenge Rating, follow these rules during combat:
> 
> - **Special Abilities.** If the monster has a special ability that deals a lot of damage but has a limited number of uses, such as a recharging breath weapon or a spell it can cast only once per day, have it use that special ability as quickly and as often as possible.
> - **Multiattack.** If the monster has Multiattack, have it use Multiattack on any of its turns in which it's not using one of its more powerful abilities.
> - **Bonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions.** If the monster has Bonus Actions, Reactions, or Legendary Actions in its stat block, make sure it uses them as often as it can.

### Immunities

This entry lists the monster's Immunities, if any. If the monster has damage and condition Immunities, the damage types are listed before the conditions. See "Playing the Game" for details.

### Gear

Monsters have proficiency with their equipment. If a monster has equipment that can be given away or retrieved, the items are listed in the Gear entry. The monster's stat block might include special flourishes that happen when the monster uses an item, and the stat block might ignore the rules in "Equipment" for that item. When used by someone else, a retrievable item uses its "Equipment" rules, ignoring any special flourishes in the stat block.

The Gear entry doesn't necessarily list all of a monster's equipment. For example, a monster that wears clothes is assumed to be dressed appropriately, and those clothes aren't in this entry.

Equipment mentioned outside the Gear entry is considered to be supernatural or highly specialized, and it is unusable when the monster is defeated.

#### Ammunition and Ranged Attacks

A monster that requires ammunition to make ranged attacks carries the necessary ammunition.

#### Equipping a Monster with Other Items

You may equip monsters with additional gear however you like, using the items in "Equipment" for inspiration. You decide how much of a monster's equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable.

Beware of giving a monster combat-oriented magic items, since those might alter the monster's Challenge Rating. If you do give a monster a magic item, the monster can have Attunement with magic items as noted in "Equipment." A monster with a class tag after its creature type is considered a member of that class for Attunement purposes.

### Senses

The Senses entry specifies a monster's Passive Perception score, as well as any special senses the monster possesses. Passive Perception and special senses are described in "Rules Glossary."

### Languages

This entry lists languages that the monster can use to communicate. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can't communicate with it, which is noted in its entry. "None" indicates that a creature doesn't comprehend any language.

#### Telepathy

Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. See "Rules Glossary" for more information.

### Challenge Rating

Challenge Rating is defined in "Rules Glossary," while guidance on using CR to plan potential combat encounters is in "Gameplay Toolbox."

#### Experience Points

The number of Experience Points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its CR, as detailed in the Experience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is awarded for defeating the monster in combat or otherwise neutralizing it.

Unless a rule says otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or another magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.

Table: Experience Points by Challenge Rating

| CR  | XP      |

#### Proficiency Bonus

A monster's Proficiency Bonus (PB) is determined by its CR, as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table, and is reflected in saving throws, skills, and other statistics where the monster's exceptional aptitude is a factor.

Table: Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating

| CR    | PB |
|-------|----|
| 0–4   | +2 |
| 5–8   | +3 |
| 9–12  | +4 |

### Traits

A monster's traits, if any, are features that are active at all times or in certain situations.

### Actions

A monster can take the actions in this section or take one of the actions available to all creatures, as described in "Playing the Game."

#### Attack Notation

The entry for a monster's attack identifies whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says otherwise. For details on different kinds of attacks, see "Playing the Game" and "Spells."

**_Hit._** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the "*Hit:*" notation.

**_Miss._** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information follows the "*Miss:*" notation.

**_Hit or Miss._** If an attack has an effect that occurs regardless of whether it hits or misses its target, that information follows the "*Hit or Miss:*" notation.

#### Saving Throw Effect Notation

If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect identifies the kind of save required and then provides the save's DC, a description of which creatures make the save, and an explanation of what happens on a failed or successful save.

"Half damage only" on a successful save means the target takes half as much damage (round down) as targets that fail the save, while also ignoring all other parts of the effect.

#### Damage Notation

A stat block usually provides both a number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. You decide whether to use the number or the die expression in parentheses; don't use both.

#### Multiattack

Some creatures can make more than one attack when they take the Attack action. Such creatures have the Multiattack entry in the "Actions" section of their stat block. This entry details the attacks a creature can make, as well as any additional abilities it can use, as part of the Attack action.

#### Spellcasting

If a monster can cast any spells, its stat block lists the spells and provides the monster's spellcasting ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving throw), and spell attack bonus (if any spells require an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell of level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can't be cast at a higher level.

A monster's spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a green hag can cast the *Invisibility* spell, but the spell has a "self only" restriction, which means the spell affects only the hag.

**_Spell Components._** The Spellcasting trait notes whether the monster's spellcasting ignores the need for certain spell components. If any spell components are required, describe the monster's use of Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that requires Material components has them.

**_Casting Times of 1+ Minutes._** If a spell has a casting time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spellcasting action, the monster doesn't cast the spell in just one action unless the action's description states otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to cast the spell, as described in "Rules Glossary."

### Bonus Action

If a monster has Bonus Action options, they are listed in this section. See "Playing the Game" for details on Bonus Actions.

### Reactions

If the monster has Reaction options, those are listed in this section along with their triggers. See "Playing the Game" for details on Reactions.

### Legendary Actions

If the monster has Legendary Action options, those are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is an action that a monster can take immediately after another creature's turn. Only one of these actions can be taken at a time and only after another creature's turn ends. The monster can't take a Legendary Action if it has the Incapacitated condition or is otherwise unable to take actions.

The monster has a limited number of Legendary Action uses, and that number is specified in the stat block. The monster expends one use whenever it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

### Limited Usage

Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the number of times they can be used. Here are the most common ways that usage is limited:

- **X/Day.** This notation means the stat block part can be used a certain number of times (represented by X) and that a monster must finish a Long Rest to regain expended uses. For example, a Reaction that includes "1/Day" means the Reaction can be taken once and that the monster must finish a Long Rest to take it again.
- **Recharge X–Y.** This notation means a monster can use the stat block part once. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll 1d6. If the roll is within the number range given in the notation (represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use of that part, which also recharges when the monster finishes a Short or Long Rest. For example, "Recharge 5–6" in an action means a monster can take the action once. Then, at the start of each of the monster's turns, it regains the use of that action if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6.
- **Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.** This notation means the monster can use the stat block part once and must then finish a Short or Long Rest to use it again.
