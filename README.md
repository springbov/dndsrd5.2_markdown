# DND 5.2 SRD to Markdown

Current Completion Status: ~5% (19 / 361 pages)

This is meant to be a conversion, of the SRD released by wizards of the coast in PDF form into markdown. It isn't meant to be anything more or less.

## Process

I used the [markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) tool to get a rough, and I mean rough, base markdown file. From there I broke it into sub files to make the work a little easier to handle mentally.

I am not using AI tools for this. I simply don't trust them to do a good enough job for this. By "good enough" I mean "100% correct to the original or better".

## Contributions

I am not planning on accepting any. I might though if the contributions are quality and don't use AI.

I may never finish this project. I provide no gauruntees of that.

But feel free to fork it and finish it yourself if you feel so inclined.

Since the goal is litterally just a file format change from PDF to markdown, and the original words aren't being changed, except for minor typos as I find them, I am releasing these files under the same license as wizards of the coast, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0.

I don't actually care if you attribute me, like really, I don't think changing document format in this case is even copywriteable (hashtag not a lawyer), but you definitely need to provide the attribution from wizards mentioned in the original PDF (and in 00_Legal.md of this repository).
