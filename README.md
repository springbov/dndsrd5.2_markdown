# DND 5.2 SRD to Markdown

Current Completion Status: ~56% (203/ 361 pages). Note, that the monsters / animal sections together are 110 pages, about 30% of the document. If we disinclude those we are ~81% done (203 / 251 pages).

This is meant to be a conversion, of the SRD released by wizards of the coast in PDF form into markdown. It isn't meant to be anything more or less.

## Process

I used a wonderful tool called [marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker) to generate a "pretty good, but still needs work" markdown file, which I then split into multiple files. So far as I can tell, the main section that came out the roughest was the monsters / animals sections. I may try and re-generate just those sections by themselves to see if I get better results.

Basically, this is a semi-automated process. I generated a base file, and then I painstakingly go through and ensure the format, tables, headings, etc... are how I want them.

## Markdown Extensions

Table captions are denoted with `Table: Caption Text` before tables.

## Contributions

I am not planning on accepting any. This isn't really a community project, more of a community service. If someone wants to fork it and turn it into a community project, then have fun with that.

I may never finish this project. I provide no gauruntees of anything.

Feel free to fork it and finish it yourself if you feel so inclined.

Since the goal is litterally just a file format change from PDF to markdown, and the original words aren't being changed, except for minor typos as I find them, I am labeling these files under the same license as wizards of the coast, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0. This is mostly just to avoid any confusion about how the license the PDF was released under works and not actually to have anyone credit me.

I don't think changing document format in this case is something I can even have a copyright for, but I'm not sure, I'm not a lawyer, but you definitely need to provide the attribution from wizards mentioned in the original PDF (and in 00_Legal.md of this repository).
